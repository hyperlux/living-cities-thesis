**For Illustrators & Designers**  
**Version:** 1.0 | February 2026  
**Related Document:** Living Cities Thesis & Koroved Masterplan

---

## Overview

This document provides detailed specifications for 10 key diagrams to be included in *Living Cities: Biology, Abundance & Meaning in the Post-Labor Age*. Each specification includes:

- **Purpose** — What the diagram communicates
- **Visual Style** — Aesthetic direction and references
- **Structural Elements** — Required components and layout
- **Color Guidance** — Palette and meaning
- **Text/Labels** — Required typography
- **Interactions** — For digital versions
- **Technical Notes** — Sizing, export requirements

**General Aesthetic:** Organic yet technical. The visual language bridges biology and systems design—think mycelial networks meeting circuit diagrams, watercolor meets vector precision. Avoid cold techno-futurism; embrace warm complexity.

# DIAGRAM 1: The 9-Organ System Map

## Purpose
The foundational diagram showing the Living City as an integrated organism. This is the visual thesis—readers should grasp the entire framework at a glance.

## Visual Style
**Reference:** Anatomical illustrations crossed with systems maps. Think Da Vinci's anatomical studies meets Buckminster Fuller's World Game. Hand-drawn quality with digital precision.

**Mood:** Alive, interconnected, breathing. Not mechanical—organic.

## Structural Elements

### Central Form
A stylized city silhouette that doubles as a body/organism shape. The outline should be recognizable as urban (buildings, infrastructure) but also readable as a living form (torso, organs visible).

### The 9 Organs — Arranged Anatomically

| Organ | Position | Visual Symbol | Color |
|-------|----------|---------------|-------|
| **1. Nourishment** | Stomach/Core | Garden terraces, root systems, plates | Verdant green (#2D5016) |
| **2. Metabolism** | Chest/Heart | Solar panels as cells, energy pulses | Solar gold (#F4A300) |
| **3. Hydration** | Kidney/Sides | Water cycles, droplets, aquifers | Deep blue (#1B4B7A) |
| **4. Digestion** | Lower intestinal | Circular arrows, decomposers, compost | Earth brown (#6B4423) |
| **5. Circulation** | Arteries throughout | Pathways, bikes, transit lines | Crimson (#C41E3A) |
| **6. Structure** | Skeleton/Frame | Buildings as bones, CLT timber | Warm grey (#8B8589) |
| **7. Cognition** | Head/Brain | Neural networks, data streams | Electric purple (#7B2D8E) |
| **8. Immunity** | Outer membrane | Shield patterns, resilience symbols | Amber (#FFB000) |
| **9. Meaning (Ninth Pillar)** | Heart center, radiating | Spiral/lotus, human figures connected | Rose gold (#B76E79) |

### Connection Lines
- All organs connected by flowing lines (not straight arrows)
- Lines should pulse/breathe — varying thickness suggesting flow
- Show bidirectional relationships (metabolism feeds nourishment; nourishment feeds metabolism)
- Use gradient colors where organs meet

### Surrounding Environment
- City sits within a bioregional context
- Rural "foodshed" ring visible at edges
- Sun, water, and earth as external inputs
- Waste/output arrows that loop back (closed system visual)

# DIAGRAM 2: Attractor Landscape Visualization

## Purpose
Illustrate the core governance insight: Living Cities use *attractors* (incentive gradients that pull behavior toward flourishing) rather than *rules* (commands that push behavior). Show how stable states emerge from gradient fields.

## Visual Style
**Reference:** Potential energy landscapes from physics, topographic maps, gravitational wells. Think of the classic "rubber sheet with heavy balls" visualization of general relativity, but with multiple basins.

**Mood:** Dynamic equilibrium. Not static—constantly shifting but with stable patterns.

## Structural Elements

### The Landscape
A 3D terrain visualization showing:

**Two Contrasting Zones:**

| Zone | Terrain | Label | Behavior Pattern |
|------|---------|-------|------------------|
| **Rules-Based** (left) | Flat plateau with walls/fences | "Compliance Zone" | Behavior stays within walls due to barriers; escapes when walls break |
| **Attractor-Based** (right) | Rolling hills with basins | "Flourishing Zone" | Behavior naturally flows toward basins; self-corrects |

### Key Features

**In the Rules Zone:**
- Walls/fences representing regulations
- Gaps where enforcement fails
- Agents (small spheres/figures) pushed against walls
- Some escaping through gaps
- Enforcement agents (different color) patrolling

**In the Attractor Zone:**
- Multiple basins/valleys at different levels
- Deepest basin labeled "Flourishing" (the goal state)
- Shallower basins labeled "Local Optimum" (good but not ideal)
- Saddle points between basins (transition paths)
- Agents naturally rolling toward basins
- No enforcers needed

### The Transition Ridge
A ridge separating the two zones, with some agents crossing from rules to attractors. Label: "The Governance Transition"

### Gradient Arrows
Show the "invisible forces" pulling agents toward basins:
- Ownership incentives
- Community connection
- Status currencies
- Meaning generation

## Visual Metaphors to Include

**The Marble Analogy:**
Small inset showing: "Drop a marble anywhere—it finds its way to the basin. No instructions needed."

**The River Analogy:**
Small inset showing: "Water doesn't need rules to find the ocean. Design the landscape; the behavior follows."

## Text Labels

**Title:** "Attractors vs. Rules: The Governance Physics"

**Subtitle:** "Rules push from behind. Attractors pull from ahead."

**Basin Labels (in the Attractor Zone):**
- Deepest: "Generous Living" or "Collective Flourishing"
- Medium: "Stable Cooperation"
- Shallow: "Self-Interest Equilibrium"

**Marginal annotations:**
- "Ownership creates stake → care emerges"
- "Circulation creates connection → community emerges"
- "Contribution creates meaning → purpose emerges"

## Color Guidance
- Rules zone: Cool grays, institutional blue (#4A5568)
- Attractor zone: Warm gradients, sunset colors (#FF6B6B → #FFE66D)
- Basins: Glowing centers (deeper = warmer glow)
- Agents: Neutral spheres with subtle human suggestion

## Technical Notes
- 3D rendering with subtle depth cues
- Consider animated version (agents rolling toward basins)
- Print version: isometric projection with clear depth

# DIAGRAM 3: Metabolic Flows Diagram

## Purpose
Show the city as a living metabolism—energy, materials, water, food, data, and value flowing through interconnected systems. Demonstrate that "economy is circulation, not accumulation."

## Visual Style
**Reference:** Sankey diagrams meets biological metabolism charts. Think cellular respiration diagrams but at city scale. Flowing, organic, with visible quantities.

**Mood:** Pulsing with life. Movement is the message.

## Structural Elements

### The Central Metabolism
City silhouette as the "cell" with visible internal processes.

### Seven Flow Systems

| Flow | Color | Width Represents | Key Nodes |
|------|-------|------------------|-----------|
| **Energy** | Gold/Orange | Megawatts | Solar farms → Storage → Buildings → Grid |
| **Water** | Blue gradient | Cubic meters | Rain → Capture → Use → Treatment → Reuse → Aquifer |
| **Food** | Green | Calories/Tons | Farms → Processing → Distribution → Consumption → Compost |
| **Materials** | Earth brown | Tons | Extraction → Manufacturing → Use → Repair → Recovery → Remanufacture |
| **Data** | Purple/Electric | Petabytes | Sensors → Aggregation → Analysis → Action → Feedback |
| **Value** | Rose gold | Currency units | Production → Circulation → Dividends → Reinvestment |
| **Care** | Warm pink | Hours/Credits | Care hubs → Recipients → Credit accumulation → Future care access |

### Flow Principles (Show Visually)

**Circulation over Extraction:**
- Flows should form LOOPS, not lines
- Every output becomes an input somewhere
- "Waste" arrows loop back to "Input"

**Blockage as Disease:**
- Include one "blocked flow" example
- Platform extraction shown as a dam/siphon
- Flow accumulates on one side, depletes on other
- Label: "Blockage = Economic Disease"

### The Value Circulation Detail
Enlarged inset showing value flow specifically:

```
Production → Data Cooperative → License Revenue → Member Dividends
     ↑                                                    ↓
     └────────────── Local Spending ←────────────────────┘
```

# DIAGRAM 4: The Governance Stack

## Purpose
Visualize the six-layer architecture of a Living City, showing how physical infrastructure supports digital systems, which generate data, governed by democratic structures, enabling economic circulation, all oriented toward the ultimate purpose of flourishing.

## Visual Style
**Reference:** Technology stack diagrams but humanized. Not cold architecture—living layers like geological strata or organism tissues.

**Mood:** Foundational. Each layer supports the next. Interdependence visible.

## Structural Elements

### The Six Layers (Bottom to Top)

| Layer | Content | Visual Treatment | Thickness |
|-------|---------|------------------|-----------|
| **1. PHYSICAL** | Buildings, infrastructure, land | Geological/architectural | Thickest (foundation) |
| **2. DIGITAL** | Sensors, networks, platforms | Circuit patterns, data streams | Medium |
| **3. DATA** | Information, patterns, insights | Flowing particles, databases | Medium |
| **4. GOVERNANCE** | Rules, decisions, participation | Assembly icons, voting, deliberation | Medium |
| **5. ECONOMIC** | Ownership, dividends, circulation | Currencies, flow arrows, stakes | Medium |
| **6. PURPOSE** | Meaning, flourishing, kindness | Human figures, community, light | Lightest (emergent) |

### Cross-Cutting Connections
Vertical lines/channels showing how lower layers enable upper layers:
- Physical sensors → Digital signals
- Digital platforms → Data generation
- Data patterns → Governance decisions
- Governance frameworks → Economic rules
- Economic security → Purpose pursuit

### The Ownership Question
At each layer, show WHO OWNS IT:

| Layer | Current Ownership (❌) | Living City Ownership (✅) |
|-------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Physical | Investors, corporations | Community land trusts, coops |
| Digital | Platform companies | Municipal open-source |
| Data | Extracted by platforms | Resident data cooperatives |
| Governance | Captured by interests | Participatory assemblies |
| Economic | Concentrated wealth | Distributed ownership |
| Purpose | Undefined | Collectively chosen |

### Anti-Capture Mechanisms
Floating "shield" icons at key points:
- Rotating governance (prevents entrenchment)
- Sunset provisions (forces re-evaluation)
- Exit rights (preserves individual agency)
- Non-alienation clauses (prevents sale to extractors)

# DIAGRAM 5: Transition Timeline (2025-2050)

## Purpose
Map the 25-year transformation window, showing the three possible scenarios (Best Case, Base Case, Worst Case), key decision points, and the phases of transition.

## Visual Style
**Reference:** Historical timelines meets scenario planning diagrams. Think Long Now Foundation aesthetics—long-term thinking made visual.

**Mood:** Urgent but hopeful. The fork in the road is NOW.

## Structural Elements

### The Branching Timeline

**Main Trunk (2025-2028):** "The Foundation Window"
- All scenarios share this phase
- Key milestones: pilot cities, proof of concept, early governance experiments

**Branch Point: 2028-2030** — "The Fork"
Three paths diverge based on political/economic choices made in this window.

### Three Scenario Paths

| Scenario | Color | Key Events | 2050 State |
|----------|-------|------------|------------|
| **A: Accelerating Adoption** | Emerald Green | 2030: National policies • 2035: 50 cities L3+ • 2040: Constitutional recognition | "Planetary metabolism visible" |
| **B: Fragmented Development** | Amber/Orange | 2030: Patchwork progress • 2035: Two-track cities • 2040: Inequality politics | "Partial adoption, better than today" |
| **C: Capture & Regression** | Crimson Red | 2030: Platform capture • 2035: Green-washed extraction • 2040: Movement rebranding | "Start over with different language" |

### The "Now" Indicator
A prominent marker at 2025-2026 with:
- "YOU ARE HERE"
- "18-month window to establish path dependencies"
- Urgency without panic

### Decision Points
Diamond-shaped decision nodes at key junctures:
- 2026: "Data cooperative or platform contract?"
- 2028: "National policy direction?"
- 2030: "Resist acquisition or sell out?"
- 2035: "Scale or stagnate?"

### Risk Callouts
Along worst-case path, warning icons for:
- "Living city" becomes marketing term
- Techno-feudalism with organic aesthetics
- Movement forced to rebrand

## Layout
Horizontal timeline as primary axis, with three paths diverging at key branch point. Each path has different visual treatment:
- Best case: Upward trajectory, brightening
- Base case: Horizontal, steady
- Worst case: Downward, darkening

# DIAGRAM 6: Status Currency Ecosystem

## Purpose
Visualize the multiple forms of status and recognition that replace money-status in a post-labor economy. Show how different "currencies" interact and create a portfolio of status sources.

## Visual Style
**Reference:** Currency exchange diagrams meets reputation network visualizations. Think multiple overlapping circles or interconnected pools.

**Mood:** Abundance of recognition. Many paths to status, not just one.

# DIAGRAM 9: Digital Twin Architecture

## Purpose
Show the "City Mind"—the cognitive layer of the Living City. Illustrate how sensors, data aggregation, AI analysis, and feedback systems create a self-aware urban organism, owned by residents rather than corporations.

## Visual Style
**Reference:** Technical architecture diagrams meets neural network visualizations. Think system architecture but organic—more mycelium than circuit board.

**Mood:** Aware but not surveillance. Intelligence, not control.

## Structural Elements

### The Three-Layer Architecture

**Layer 1: SENSING (Input)**
```
Physical World
├── Environmental Sensors (air, water, noise, temperature)
├── Infrastructure Sensors (energy, transit, water flow)
├── Voluntary Input (resident apps, surveys, reports)
└── Edge Computing (local processing, privacy preservation)
```

**Layer 2: PROCESSING (Analysis)**
```
Data Cooperative Core
├── Federated Learning (models train without centralizing data)
├── Privacy-Preserving Analytics (differential privacy, k-anonymity)
├── Pattern Recognition (trends, anomalies, predictions)
└── Collective Intelligence (aggregated insights)
```

**Layer 3: ACTION (Output)**
```
Response Systems
├── Automated Optimization (traffic, energy, water)
├── Alert & Notification (residents, managers)
├── Decision Support (governance, planning)
└── Feedback Loops (learning, improving)
```

### The Ownership Model (Critical Differentiation)

**Comparison Panel:**

| Aspect | Platform Model ❌ | Living City Model ✅ |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|
| Data ownership | Corporation | Resident cooperative |
| Insights | Proprietary | Commons |
| Revenue | Shareholders | Member dividends |
| Control | Remote HQ | Local governance |
| Algorithm | Black box | Transparent, auditable |
| Purpose | Extraction | Service |

### The Neural Analogy
Visual showing city-as-brain:
- Sensors = sensory neurons
- Data aggregation = thalamus (routing)
- Analysis = cortex (processing)
- Actions = motor neurons
- Feedback = learning loops

### Key Components (Icons)

| Component | Visual |
|-----------|--------|
| Sensor nodes | Small dots distributed |
| Edge processors | Neighborhood-scale boxes |
| Data cooperative | Central collective symbol |
| Governance layer | Assembly/voting icons |
| Action systems | Output arrows to services |

### Privacy Architecture Detail

```
Raw Data → [Anonymization] → Aggregated Patterns → [Consent Layer] → Use Cases
    │                                                      │
