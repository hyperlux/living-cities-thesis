# APPENDIX J: GLOSSARY

*Key terms defined as used in the Living Cities framework.*

---

## A

**Abundance Dividend**
A regular payment to residents derived from the surplus value created by collective systems (energy generation, data licensing, land value capture). Modeled on the Alaska Permanent Fund. Distributes shared wealth rather than extracting it.

**Adaptive Reuse**
Converting existing buildings to new purposes rather than demolition and new construction. Preserves embodied energy and community character.

**Antifragility**
A property of systems that gain from disorder, stress, and volatility (term coined by Nassim Taleb). Beyond resilience (surviving stress) to becoming stronger through stress. Goal for Living City systems design.

**Attractor**
In Living City governance, an incentive gradient that pulls behavior toward desired outcomes without requiring enforcement. Based on dynamical systems theory. Contrast with rules, which specify behavior and require monitoring and enforcement.

---

## B

**Bioregion**
A geographic area defined by natural boundaries (watersheds, ecosystems) rather than political borders. Framework for connecting urban and rural areas. The "lungs" the city breathes through.

**Building Energy Cooperative**
Resident-owned organization that collectively generates, stores, and manages energy for a building or block. Members share costs and benefits. Democratic governance.

---

## C

**Care Hub**
A physical space where helping others is the primary activity. Intergenerational skill-sharing, mutual support, crisis response. One of the "five gardens" where meaning grows.

**Cell (Metabolic Citizenship)**
The identity shift from passive taxpayer/consumer to active participant in city systems. As a cell contributes to and depends on the organism, the metabolic citizen contributes to and benefits from city flows. Final stage of the identity spectrum.

**Circulation**
The movement organ of the Living City. Transportation systems designed so the best system is one you don't need—with everything daily within walking distance. Streets as places for people, not just movement of vehicles.

**Cognition**
The "city mind" organ. Data systems that enable the city to know itself—not through surveillance of individuals but awareness of patterns. Digital twin, sensor networks, data cooperatives.

**Community Land Trust (CLT)**
Nonprofit organization that holds land in perpetual trust for community benefit. Sells or rents buildings while retaining land ownership. Ground lease with resale restrictions ensures permanent affordability.

**Contemplative Infrastructure**
Physical spaces designed for reflection, meditation, and holding life's big questions. Secular sanctuaries. Part of meaning infrastructure.

**Creation Commons**
Maker spaces, art studios, workshops where new things come into being. One of the "five gardens" where meaning grows.

---

## D

**Data Cooperative**
Member-owned organization that collectively manages, licenses, and benefits from aggregated data. Members retain ownership of personal data; cooperative holds it as fiduciary. Democratic governance with data dividends.

**Data Dividend**
Payments to data cooperative members from revenue generated by licensing aggregated data. Returns value to data creators.

**Digital Twin**
Virtual model of the city's physical systems that updates in real-time. Enables simulation, optimization, and coordination across systems.

**Digestion**
The waste organ of the Living City. Systems where every output becomes an input. "Waste" as an archaic concept.

---

## E

**Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)**
Policy framework making manufacturers responsible for products through end-of-life. Shifts waste management burden upstream.

---

## F

**15-Minute City**
Urban planning concept where daily needs (food, healthcare, education, work, leisure) are accessible within a 15-minute walk or bike ride. Foundation for Living City circulation.

**Five Gardens**
The five spaces where meaning grows: Care Hubs, Practice Studios, Contemplative Infrastructure, Creation Commons, Stewardship Roles.

**Food Hub**
A facility that aggregates, stores, processes, and/or distributes locally produced food. Connects local growers with local consumers.

**Foodshed**
The geographic area that supplies a community with food, analogous to a watershed for water. Typically defined as 50-100 mile radius.

**Four Work Functions**
The four things that work provided beyond income: temporal structure, status, connection, meaning. The Living City must provide alternatives for each.

---

## G

**Generous Living**
The quality of life in a mature Living City. Where giving feels natural, helping is normal, quiet kindness is the default. The cathedral being built; systems are the scaffolding.

**Ground Lease**
In a CLT, the legal agreement giving a homeowner the right to use land held in trust. Typically 99 years, renewable. Contains affordability restrictions.

**Greywater**
Wastewater from sinks, showers, laundry—excluding toilet waste. Can be treated and reused for irrigation, reducing fresh water demand.

---

## H

**Hydration**
The water organ of the Living City. Systems where water cycles (not flows), passing through multiple uses before leaving the city.

---

## I

**Immunity**
The resilience organ of the Living City. Systems designed for antifragility—not just surviving disruption but growing stronger from it. Redundancy, mutual aid, recovery capacity.

---

## L

**Land-Value Capture**
Policy mechanism for recovering increases in land value that result from public investment (transit, parks, rezoning) rather than owner effort. Funds public benefit.

**Living Building**
A building that generates more energy than it uses, captures water, processes waste, and enhances occupant health. Certification by International Living Future Institute.

**Living City**
An urban organism with eight biological organs plus a ninth pillar of meaning, governed by attractors rather than rules, owned by its residents, circulating value until it multiplies.

**Living City Scale (L1-L5)**
Maturity assessment framework:
- L1: Fragmented departments, pilot projects
- L2: Some system integration, multiple pilots scaling
- L3: Cross-system integration, governance innovation, measurable outcomes
- L4: Full organ integration, distributed ownership, resident participation
- L5: Mature organism with meaning infrastructure, model for replication

---

## M

**Mass Timber**
Engineered wood products (CLT, glulam) that allow wood construction at scale previously requiring steel/concrete. Sequesters carbon in buildings.

**Meaning Infrastructure**
The Ninth Pillar. Physical spaces, activities, and rituals that create conditions for meaningful lives beyond work. The integrative organ that gives purpose to the other eight.

**Metabolic Citizenship**
The paradigm shift from taxpayer/consumer to active participant ("cell") in city systems. Rights AND responsibilities. The identity that enables Living City governance.

**Metabolism**
The energy organ of the Living City. Distributed generation, storage, and management. The city as a solar panel generating more than it consumes.

**Microgrid**
Localized electrical grid that can operate connected to or independently from the main grid. Enables resilience and renewable integration.

**Mutual Aid Network**
Neighbor-to-neighbor support systems organized for reciprocal help rather than charity. Critical for resilience and meaning.

---

## N

**Ninth Pillar**
Meaning infrastructure—the integrative organ that holds the other eight together. What gives the Living City its purpose. Care hubs, practice studios, contemplative spaces, creation commons, stewardship roles, and secular rituals.

**Nourishment**
The food organ of the Living City. Systems where the city feeds itself substantially with fresh local food measured in hours from harvest.

---

## O

**Open Source Governance**
Transparent, participatory, replicable governance models. Code, processes, and documents shared freely for others to adapt.

**Organ**
One of the eight biological systems of the Living City (Nourishment, Metabolism, Hydration, Digestion, Circulation, Structure, Cognition, Immunity) plus the integrative Ninth Pillar (Meaning).

**Organ Health Scorecard**
Diagnostic tool with 5-7 indicators per organ rated red/yellow/green. Used for baseline assessment and progress tracking.

---

## P

**Participatory Budgeting**
Democratic process where residents directly decide how to spend a portion of public funds. Builds civic capacity and metabolic citizenship.

**Practice Studio**
Space for skill development and mastery. Flow states through challenge. One of the "five gardens" where meaning grows.

---

## Q

**Quiet Kindness**
The state where giving feels natural and helping is normal—not heroic but the way things work. The ultimate purpose of Living City systems. The cathedral being built.

---

## R

**Repair Café**
Community event where residents bring broken items and volunteer "fixers" help repair them. Extends product life, builds community, teaches skills.

**Resale Formula**
In CLT homeownership, the formula determining the sale price when a homeowner sells. Balances owner equity-building with permanent affordability. Typically allows owner to recover purchase price + improvements + share of appreciation.

**Resilience Hub**
Neighborhood-scale facility that provides critical services during emergencies and community gathering year-round. Power, water, supplies, communication, gathering space.

**Rural-Urban Symbiosis**
Integration of urban and rural systems through foodsheds, energysheds, and watersheds. The countryside as the lung, not the periphery.

---

## S

**Secular Ritual**
Community practices marking time, transitions, and belonging without requiring religious belief. Morning gatherings, seasonal celebrations, life-stage ceremonies. Critical for temporal structure and meaning.

**Stewardship Role**
Recognized position where individuals take responsibility for something beyond themselves—watershed, pollinators, cultural memory. One of the "five gardens" where meaning grows.

**Structure**
The building organ of the Living City. Buildings that breathe, eat, heal—grown rather than constructed, owned collectively, adapted over centuries.

**Superblock**
Street network redesign that redirects through-traffic to perimeter roads, creating pedestrian-priority interior. Model from Barcelona.

---

## T

**Temporal Commons**
Shared time structures—daily rhythms, weekly cycles, seasonal celebrations—that replace work's temporal organization. Voluntary, communal, ritualized.

**Temporal Structure**
One of the four work functions. How time is organized into meaningful containers. Living City replacement: the city's circadian rhythm through shared events and rituals.

---

## V

**Vision Zero**
Traffic safety philosophy with the goal of zero fatalities. Designs streets for human safety rather than traffic throughput.

---

## W

**Watershed**
The area draining to a common water body. Natural boundary for bioregional governance.
