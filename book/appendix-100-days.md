# Appendix: The First 100 Days Mayoral Playbook

## A Week-by-Week Action Plan for Living City Transition

*"The best time to plant a tree was twenty years ago. The second best time is now."*
— Chinese Proverb

---

## Introduction

This playbook provides a practical, day-by-day roadmap for any mayor committed to transforming their city into a living city. The first 100 days set the trajectory. Done right, you'll build momentum, demonstrate visible progress, establish coalitions, launch pilots, and create the political conditions for deeper transformation.

This is not a theoretical framework—it's a battle-tested operational guide. Each week has specific actions, responsible parties, deliverables, and success metrics.

### How to Use This Playbook

- **Read the entire document first** before taking action
- **Customize for your context**—not all cities start from the same place
- **Assign each action to a specific person** with a deadline
- **Track progress weekly** using the provided dashboards
- **Expect resistance**—the playbook includes strategies for overcoming it

| **Foundation** | 1-2 | Assessment, team building, listening |
| **Quick Wins** | 3-4 | Visible victories, building credibility |

### Appendix E: Resistance Response Guide

**Common Objections and Responses:**

| Objection | Response Strategy | Key Data Points |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **"We can't afford this"** | Emphasize cost savings, grants, avoided costs | Trees save $2.70 per $1 invested (USFS). Green infrastructure is 40% cheaper than gray over lifecycle. |
| **"We have more urgent priorities"** | Connect living city to priorities (jobs, health, safety) | Air quality improvements reduce ER visits by 20%. Heat mitigation prevents deaths. |
| **"This hurts development"** | Show green premium and developer interest | Green buildings command 7% higher rents. Buyers pay more for tree-lined streets. |
| **"It's just environmental activism"** | Frame as public health, economic development, resilience | 72% of residents support more green space. Business recruitment cites livability. |
| **"One city can't make a difference"** | Focus on local benefits while noting global contribution | All benefits are local: cleaner air, cooler temps, flood protection in YOUR neighborhood. |
| **"The science isn't settled"** | Stick to proven, local benefits | Focus on measurable outcomes: stormwater, heat, air quality—not climate debate. |
| **"Maintenance is too expensive"** | Show reduced maintenance for native landscapes | Native plantings require 50% less maintenance after establishment. |
| **"People don't want wild landscapes"** | Demonstrate community support and education | Polls show 65%+ support naturalized parks. Signage increases acceptance. |

**Stakeholder-Specific Messaging:**

**For fiscal conservatives:**
"Living city investments are fiscally responsible. Every $1 spent on trees returns $2.70 in benefits. Green infrastructure costs 40% less than gray over its lifecycle. And we're pursuing grants and partnerships to minimize taxpayer burden."

**For business owners:**
"Living cities are economic magnets. Companies relocate for quality of life. Walkable, green districts attract more foot traffic and higher retail sales. Property values in tree-lined neighborhoods are 10-20% higher."

**For skeptical residents:**
"I understand the skepticism—but this isn't about polar bears or distant problems. It's about your neighborhood. Cleaner air for your kids. Cooler temps in summer. Less flooding when it rains. More birds and butterflies in your backyard. That's what a living city delivers."

## Final Word: The Mayor's Commitment

The first 100 days set the trajectory. They don't complete the transformation—that's a decade's work, at minimum—but they determine whether transformation is possible at all.

Done right, these 100 days will:

- **Establish credibility** through visible action, not just promises
- **Build coalition** by bringing diverse stakeholders together around shared vision
- **Create proof points** through pilots that demonstrate what's possible
- **Change the culture** by embedding living city thinking across government
- **Generate momentum** that carries you through the inevitable obstacles ahead

The living city isn't a destination; it's a direction. Every tree planted, every bioswale installed, every policy reformed moves your city toward a future where nature and humanity thrive together.

These first 100 days are your opening move. Make them count.
