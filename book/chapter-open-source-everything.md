## Chapter 21: Open Source Everything

### The Cathedral and the Neighborhood

In 1997, Eric Raymond published "The Cathedral and the Bazaar," arguing that software developed by distributed communities of volunteers could outperform software developed by centralized corporate teams. He was right. Linux runs the internet. Apache serves the web. Firefox opened the browser market. Android powers most of the world's smartphones. Wikipedia replaced Britannica. Git coordinates millions of developers. The evidence is conclusive: for software, open source won.

The question this chapter asks is: what happens when the same logic escapes software?

It already has. Open source now operates across semiconductors, physical machines, medicine, agriculture, and governance. The pattern that transformed code is transforming atoms. The Living City is, in its deepest architectural logic, an open-source project: a set of shared designs, locally fabricated, collectively improved, freely available to anyone who wants to build one.

### Open Source Escapes Software

**Semiconductors: RISC-V is eating the chip industry.**

RISC-V is an open-source instruction set architecture, the fundamental set of commands that a processor chip understands. It was developed at UC Berkeley and released freely in 2010. Since then, it has grown from academic curiosity to existential threat to ARM and x86 dominance.

China's Xiangshan open-source RISC-V core (KMHv2) now achieves 15 per GHz on SPECCPU2006, approaching ARM Neoverse N2 performance. This is an open-source chip matching proprietary ones. Google, Qualcomm, and Intel are all investing heavily in RISC-V. Google is exploring it for data centers and Android. Germany's High-Tech Agenda 2025 explicitly published a challenge on open-source tools for chip design.

RISC-V eliminates royalty fees, the licensing model that kept chip design the exclusive domain of a few corporations with deep pockets. The most capital-intensive hardware on Earth is being democratized.

**Physical machines: Open Source Ecology's Civilization Starter Kit.**

Marcin Jakubowski's Open Source Ecology (OSE) project received an MIT Technology Review feature in October 2025. The Global Village Construction Set: 50 machines that can "build civilization from scratch." All schematics freely available online. Open-source tractor, 3D printer, power cube (modular hydraulic unit), CNC mill, brick press, sawmill, wind turbines, micro-homes. Modular "Lego block" design where machines reconfigure for multiple purposes.

OSE's explicit goal: "Create an open source economy, an efficient economy which increases innovation by open collaboration." Their model, Distributed Market Substitution, replaces proprietary machines with open designs through quality and cost advantage. Not ideology. Economics.

**Medicine: Open Insulin and Open Source Delivery.**

The Open Insulin Project continues developing open-source protocols for insulin production: community-owned, transparent pricing. A New England Journal of Medicine study validated open-source automated insulin delivery systems in a multicenter clinical trial. Open-source medical devices have passed clinical validation. Open-source ultra-low-cost insulin pump designs have been published in peer-reviewed journals. Ten major open-source pharmaceutical tools (R, Python, cheminformatics) are now standard across the pharmaceutical industry.

**Agriculture: Right to Repair Breakthrough.**

75% of U.S. agricultural machinery is now covered under right-to-repair memoranda of understanding with the American Farm Bureau Federation. Colorado granted farmers the state-law right to repair in 2023. Open-source precision agriculture tools combining open hardware, software, and data for farming have been reviewed in Oxford Academic. The John Deere monopoly ($1.2 billion per year in repair revenue) is breaking.

**Governance: Institutions Recognize Open Source as Infrastructure.**

The United Nations held Open Source Week in June 2025 at UN headquarters in New York City, treating open source as global infrastructure for the Sustainable Development Goals, with hackathons in the ECOSOC Chamber.

The European Union launched the Digital Commons European Digital Infrastructure Consortium (EDIC) in December 2025: multiple EU nations pooling resources for shared open-source digital infrastructure. Germany's ZENDIS coordinates federal open-source adoption. Germany's Sovereign Tech Fund explicitly funds open-source infrastructure for digital sovereignty.

Open source is no longer a development methodology. It is being recognized as a category of infrastructure, like roads, water, and electricity.

### AI Makes Open Source Win for Intelligence

The most powerful technology in human history is becoming a commons.

In a single year, the performance gap between open-source and proprietary AI models collapsed from 17.5 percentage points to 0.3% on key benchmarks. The numbers:

DeepSeek V3.2 (December 2025): achieves parity with GPT-5 on reasoning benchmarks. 671 billion total parameters, only 37 billion active. Cost: $0.26 per million input tokens, ten times cheaper than GPT-5.2 Pro.

Qwen3-235B: matches or beats GPT-4o on most benchmarks. Active parameters: only 22 billion.

Llama 4 Scout: 10 million token context window. Runs on a single H100 GPU.

Open source now represents 62.8% of AI models by count. On Chatbot Arena (5 million+ human votes), the gap shrank from 8% to 1.7%.

This means the cognitive infrastructure for the post-labor transition, the AI systems that will design buildings, diagnose diseases, tutor students, model policy, and manage urban metabolism, does not need to be rented from a few corporations. It can be owned by the commons.

36 million new developers joined GitHub in 2025 alone. India added 5.2 million. Open-source AI is becoming genuinely global.

### The Physical Loop: AI + Open Source + Fab Labs

The convergence of AI, open-source design, and distributed fabrication creates a loop that transforms physical production the way open source transformed software:

Step 1. AI generates the design. Generative AI explores thousands of optimized variations simultaneously, producing structures that humans could not conceive. Parametric facades, topologically optimized components, climate-responsive envelopes. Every design unique, every design optimal for its context.

Step 2. Open-source plans are shared globally. WikiHouse-style platforms make designs downloadable. Anyone can access, modify, improve, and redistribute. The Linux of housing.

Step 3. Local fabrication. CNC routers cut timber frames. 3D printers produce structural components. Robotic arms assemble. No centralized factory needed. The first fab lab started at MIT in 2002 as a teaching experiment. Today there are over 1,500 fab labs in 90+ countries on six continents.

Step 4. Community assembly. WikiHouse-style snap-together systems, assembled by non-specialists. Four people and a weekend can raise a house frame.

Step 5. Living materials grown locally. Mycelium insulation, bio-concrete panels, algae photobioreactors. Ultimate local sourcing: grown from agricultural waste.

Step 6. Digital twin tracks performance. Every building streams data: energy, temperature, structural health, air quality. This data feeds back to improve future designs globally.

The supply chain inverts completely:

Old model: global supply chain to central factory to truck to site to expensive specialists.

New model: open design to local materials to local fabrication to community assembly to living building.

The feedback loop is the key. In industrial manufacturing, quality requires centralized control. In open-source distributed manufacturing, quality improves with distribution. More users equal more iterations equal better designs. A WikiHouse design used in Portland, Nairobi, and Copenhagen gets tested in three different climates simultaneously. Each installation generates data that improves the design for the next one.

### WikiHouse: The Working Proof

WikiHouse, developed by Open Systems Lab in the UK, is the clearest demonstration of open-source physical production at building scale.

Open-source building system. Digitally fabricated everywhere. Structural components manufactured by a distributed network of small, local CNC fabricators, not a single centralized factory. "More flexible, more resilient, supports local companies."

Designs downloadable, fabrication local, assembly by non-specialists. Cost estimation tools built in: materials, labor, carbon tracking. Ten-year new-build warranty available in the UK. Mortgage-compatible. Materials: OSB3 (cheaper, UK-grown) or plywood (lighter, suitable for 5-meter-plus spans).

WikiHouse is not a prototype. It is a building system producing real homes that meet real building codes with real warranties and real mortgages. It happens to be open source. "Open source, like bricks": the technology is the commons; the building is yours.

Combined with AI-generated design optimization and local material sourcing (including mycelium-based insulation), WikiHouse points toward a building industry where every home is unique, every home is optimized for its site and inhabitants, and no design is proprietary.

### The Fab City Movement: Cities That Make What They Consume

The Fab City initiative, born from the global fab lab network, proposes that cities should produce most of what they consume within their own boundaries by 2054. Not autarky. Not isolation. Local production of essentials, with global exchange of knowledge and designs.

The Fab City Awards 2025 received 56 submissions from six continents, with heavy representation from the Global South. Winners demonstrate that open-source distributed manufacturing is not a rich-world hobby:

**Sifais FabLab, La Carpio, Costa Rica.** 900 square meters. 350,000+ volunteer hours. 2+ social enterprises. Makers generating income locally. Located in one of Central America's most marginalized communities. Not a tech playground for the privileged. A community anchor for the excluded.

**Madrid CIEC, Spain.** Public-private circular economy hub. 97 startups supported. 280 new jobs created. 4,000 students reached. Madrid's first public wooden building (2,000 square meters).

**Gut Einern, Germany.** Rural-urban learning hub with permaculture, CNC farming modules, and mobile learning units.

**Kovai BSF, India.** Turns organic waste into high-protein animal feed. Processes 500 kg of waste per day. Avoids 450 kg of CO2 per ton. 40 to 50 times faster than composting.

The LAUDS framework (Local, Accessible, Urban, Digital, Sustainable) is the institutional form for distributed production. It is the organizational logic that connects fab labs into a manufacturing ecosystem.

### Open Source Ecology and the Civilization Starter Kit

Marcin Jakubowski has been building the Global Village Construction Set since 2003. Fifty industrial machines, open source, modular, buildable for a fraction of commercial costs. The machines include:

Tractor. Brick press. CNC mill. 3D printer. Sawmill. Wind turbine. Solar concentrator. Power cube (modular hydraulic unit). Micro-house construction system.

The vision: "the means of production become commons." Not through nationalization or revolution. Through open design and distributed manufacturing. Anyone can download the plans, source local materials, and build the machines. The designs improve through collective iteration. Each build reveals problems that get fixed in the next version.

OSE's approach connects directly to the Living City thesis. The city does not need to import its productive capacity from global supply chains. It builds the capacity from open designs, using local materials, maintained by local practitioners. The guild system from Chapter 17 maps onto this: a repair guild that maintains the CNC mill, a fabrication guild that operates the 3D printer, a construction guild that raises WikiHouse frames. Not employment. Practice. Not wage labor. Craft.

### Trust and Reputation: The Missing Infrastructure

Open source at physical scale requires trust infrastructure that software open source takes for granted.

When you download a Linux package, a chain of digital signatures verifies its integrity. When you download a WikiHouse design and fabricate it from plywood, the stakes are different. Structural failure means a roof collapse, not a software crash. The trust question is: how do you know this design will hold?

Several systems are emerging:

**Portfolio-based reputation.** Your work speaks for itself. Curated, published, reviewed by peers. The GitHub of physical production: a history of what you have built, with verified outcomes.

**Peer review guilds.** Practitioner communities that evaluate work not for academic journals but for the commons. If the design is good, it gets replicated, forked, built upon. If it fails, the failure is documented and the design is improved.

**Guild marks.** Quality certifications issued by practitioner communities, not institutions. A "structural integrity" guild mark on a WikiHouse design means it has been reviewed by qualified practitioners and tested in multiple installations. The guild stake their own reputation on the mark.

**Digital twin verification.** Every building streams performance data. A WikiHouse design that has been installed in 500 locations, all streaming structural health data for five years, carries more trust than any single engineer's stamp. The data is the certification.

**Open-source testing protocols.** Standardized testing procedures, freely available, that any fabricator can run. Load tests, weathering tests, fire tests. The protocols themselves are open source: transparent, improvable, and trustworthy precisely because they are open to scrutiny.

These trust systems already exist in embryonic form. Open-source software has GitHub contributions as reputation. Craft communities have journeyman certification. Academic pre-print servers have open peer review. In a post-labor world, they become the primary system of meritocratic validation, the guild system updated for the digital age.

### The City as Platform for Open Production

The Living City is, at its deepest level, a platform for open production.

The neighborhood fab lab is not just a workshop. It is a node in a global network of shared designs and local fabrication. A repair innovation developed in the Minneapolis fab lab gets documented, uploaded, and replicated in the Nairobi fab lab the next morning. A structural optimization discovered through digital twin analysis in Copenhagen improves the WikiHouse template used in Costa Rica.

The commons kitchen from Chapter 17 is open-source production applied to food. Recipes shared, techniques demonstrated, improvements incorporated. The movement pavilion is open-source production applied to health. Movement practices shared across communities, adapted locally, improved through practice.

The city itself is the product, continuously improved through collective iteration. Every neighborhood is a testbed. Every building is a prototype that generates data for the next version. Every resident is a potential contributor. The sharp boundary between producer and consumer that Neil Gershenfeld described, the one that fab labs are dissolving, disappears entirely when the city is the fab lab.

### The Sustainability Paradox: Funding and Governing the Commons

Open source creates abundance. But abundance is not free to maintain. The tragedy of the commons, Hardin's famous framing, was always incomplete (Elinor Ostrom won the Nobel Prize for proving it), but the sustainability question is real.

**The current crisis:**
- 60% of open-source maintainers report readiness to walk away
- 73% of developers have experienced burnout
- 98% of organizations use cloud-native open-source technologies
- 52% consume AI models without training their own, meaning they depend on infrastructure they do not fund
- curl, which runs on 50 billion devices, shut down its bug bounty program in January 2026 after receiving 20 AI-generated fake security reports in 21 days, zero valid

The pattern: open source has become civilization-critical infrastructure maintained by burned-out volunteers. AI is making this worse, not better, because it lowers the barrier to contributing noise, not just signal. Maintainers become the bottleneck, drowning in plausible-looking garbage.

**The solutions emerging:**

Government recognition of open source as infrastructure. The EU Digital Commons EDIC treats open-source software as shared public infrastructure, like roads. Germany's Sovereign Tech Fund explicitly funds maintenance and development. The UN frames open source as foundational to the Sustainable Development Goals. This is the most important shift: when governments fund open source the way they fund highways, the sustainability crisis ends.

Quadratic funding. Gitcoin and the Ethereum ecosystem have distributed over $150 million through mechanisms that amplify small donations and weight breadth of support over depth. Democratic resource allocation for public goods.

Retroactive public goods funding. The Optimism network's RetroPGF funds projects that already created public value, rather than speculating on promises. You get funded because your work demonstrably helped people, not because you wrote a convincing grant proposal.

The Living City contributes to the solution. The community infrastructure fund described in Chapter 17 (0.5% of municipal budget dedicated to neighborhood-scale projects) extends to open-source production infrastructure. The fab lab is funded the way the library is funded: as public infrastructure that generates value beyond what any market transaction can capture.

### Elinor Ostrom's Principles, Updated

Ostrom identified eight principles for governing commons resources: clear boundaries, proportional costs and benefits, collective choice, monitoring, graduated sanctions, conflict resolution, recognition of self-governance, and nested enterprises. These principles were derived from studying fisheries, irrigation systems, and forests. They remain foundational.

But digital and AI-augmented commons require updates:

**Dynamic boundaries.** Physical commons (a fishery, a forest) have stable boundaries. Digital commons evolve faster than governance can adapt. Open-source AI models are updated monthly. The governance system must be as agile as the technology it governs.

**Non-rivalrous accounting.** Using a fishery depletes it. Using an open-source design does not. The economic logic is fundamentally different. Governance must account for resources that are not diminished by use, only by neglect of maintenance.

**Global scale.** Ostrom's commons were local. Open-source production networks are global. A WikiHouse design used on six continents needs governance that spans cultures, legal systems, and languages.

**Machine participants.** AI agents are increasingly contributors to and consumers of commons resources. Governance must account for non-human participants that can generate both enormous value and enormous noise.

The Living City's nested governance structure from Chapter 20 maps onto these requirements: neighborhood assemblies for local production decisions, guild senates for domain-specific standards, and global protocols for minimum quality floors. The governance of open-source physical production becomes a instance of the city's broader governance architecture.

### Challenges We're Honest About

**Quality assurance at scale.** When a software bug crashes a program, you restart it. When a structural design flaw collapses a roof, someone dies. Open-source physical production requires more rigorous quality assurance than open-source software. Building codes, structural engineering review, material testing, and safety certification cannot be crowdsourced the way bug fixes can. The trust infrastructure described above is nascent. It needs to mature before open-source construction can scale to millions of buildings.

**The AI slop problem for physical goods.** AI lowers the barrier to contributing noise, not just signal. In software, this means fake bug reports and low-quality pull requests. In physical production, it could mean AI-generated designs that look optimized but have subtle structural flaws. The self-correcting mechanism (a badly designed physical object breaks) is real but insufficient. It corrects after failure. The goal is to prevent failure. Peer review guilds, digital twin verification, and standardized testing protocols are the answer. They need investment and institutional support.

**Power concentration.** Open source alone does not solve inequality. If a few corporations control AI infrastructure while open-source models run on their hardware, the commons is captured. The AI Commons question, articulated in a February 2026 paper from Shanghai International Studies University, is precise: traditional commons theory addresses competitively scarce resources with balanced power structures and stable boundaries. AI resources are non-rivalrous and composite, governed by technological oligopoly, with constantly evolving boundaries. Applying old commons logic to AI is a "category mistake." Anti-monopoly governance, public ownership of AI infrastructure, and Global South participation are prerequisites, not afterthoughts.

**Intellectual property transition.** Open-source production requires a fundamental rethinking of intellectual property law. Patents, copyrights, and trade secrets were designed to incentivize innovation by granting temporary monopolies. Open source incentivizes innovation by eliminating monopolies. The legal transition is messy, contested, and politically charged. The Creative Commons licensing model provides a framework, but extending it from digital works to physical designs, material formulations, and manufacturing processes raises unresolved legal questions.

**Global South participation.** Open-source production could enable Global South leapfrogging: skip industrial manufacturing entirely, go directly to distributed, open, commons-based production. The Fab City Awards show this is already happening (Costa Rica, India). But the digital divide is real. Fab labs require equipment ($50,000 to $200,000 for a basic setup), internet connectivity, and trained facilitators. Without deliberate investment, open-source production becomes another rich-world innovation that arrives in the Global South a decade late, stripped of its democratic potential.

**Maintainer sustainability.** The burnout crisis is real. Building physical infrastructure on the labor of volunteers who are 60% ready to walk away is not sustainable. Government funding, institutional support, and new economic models (quadratic funding, sovereign tech funds, community infrastructure budgets) are necessary. The Living City's financial architecture must include explicit line items for open-source infrastructure maintenance.

### Where It's Already Working

**RISC-V.** Open-source chip architecture approaching proprietary performance. Backed by Google, Qualcomm, Intel, and the European Union. The most capital-intensive hardware industry on Earth is being democratized. Not in theory. In production.

**WikiHouse.** Real homes, real building codes, real warranties, real mortgages. Open-source construction with a 10-year warranty in the UK. Fabricated by distributed networks of local CNC fabricators. Already proving that housing can be produced the way software is developed: openly, collaboratively, continuously improved.

**Fab City network.** 1,500+ fab labs on six continents. 56 submissions from six continents for the 2025 awards. Community manufacturing hubs producing everything from medical devices to furniture to building components. Thriving in the Global South as well as the North.

**Open Source Ecology.** 50 industrial machines, open source, modular, buildable for a fraction of commercial costs. Featured in MIT Technology Review (October 2025). Proving that the means of physical production can be commons.

**Open Insulin Project.** Open-source protocols for insulin production validated in peer-reviewed clinical trials. Proving that open source can operate in the most regulated, highest-stakes domains.

**EU Digital Commons EDIC.** Multiple European nations pooling resources for shared open-source digital infrastructure. The institutional recognition that open source is infrastructure, not ideology.

**Gitcoin and quadratic funding.** $150 million+ distributed through democratic resource allocation. Proving that public goods can be funded without either government bureaucracy or market competition. Community conviction as a funding mechanism.

---

### The One-Liner

Open source won for code. AI made it win for intelligence. The question now is whether we build the governance to make it win for everything, or let abundance be captured by the few.

The Living City is the answer to that question. It is the governance architecture, the physical infrastructure, and the community institution that ensures open-source abundance reaches everyone. Not a marketplace where commons are sold. A commons where markets serve the community.

The cathedral is beautiful. But the neighborhood builds itself.
