# Living Cities as Cultural Evolution

## How Urban Transformation Spreads Memetically

---

### Introduction: The City as Cultural Organism

Cities do not merely contain culture—they *are* culture, crystallized into physical form and continuously evolving through the same mechanisms that govern the spread of ideas, beliefs, and behaviors. When we observe a bike lane appearing in Copenhagen, then Amsterdam, then Bogotá, then New York, we are not witnessing independent invention but memetic transmission: the replication, variation, and selection of urban forms across a global network of interconnected minds and municipalities.

Richard Dawkins introduced the concept of the meme in 1976 as a unit of cultural transmission—an idea that spreads from brain to brain, subject to evolutionary pressures analogous to those shaping genetic inheritance. What Dawkins perhaps did not anticipate was how powerfully this framework would apply to the built environment itself. Streets, plazas, bike infrastructure, public seating arrangements—these are not merely functional objects but cultural artifacts that carry embedded values, replicate through imitation, and compete for adoption in the finite ecosystem of urban space.

The living city, understood through this lens, becomes a site of continuous cultural evolution. Its organs—transportation networks, public spaces, governance systems, commercial districts—do not change randomly but through processes of memetic selection. Ideas that prove their fitness in one context become candidates for adoption elsewhere. They mutate as they travel, adapting to local conditions while retaining recognizable features of their origin. Some urban memes achieve pandemic spread; others remain endemic to particular regions; still others go extinct, remembered only in planning archives and academic papers.

This chapter examines urban transformation as cultural evolution, focusing on five phenomena that illuminate how cities change memetically: the spread patterns of tactical urbanism, the viral success of the parklet, the global adoption of Barcelona's superblock model, the emergence of secular ritual design, and the role of art as a diagnostic indicator of urban health. Together, these cases reveal a city not as a machine to be engineered but as a living cultural organism, continuously shaped by the ideas that inhabit it.

### Tactical Urbanism: The Epidemiology of Guerrilla Intervention

Tactical urbanism—the practice of implementing low-cost, temporary interventions to catalyze long-term urban change—represents perhaps the purest example of memetic transmission in contemporary city-making. Unlike traditional planning, which moves through bureaucratic channels at institutional speeds, tactical urbanism spreads virally, jumping from city to city through networks of activists, planners, and media coverage that operate largely outside formal governmental structures.

The epidemiology of tactical urbanism reveals characteristic patterns. First, there is the **index case**: an initial intervention, often born of frustration with slow institutional processes, that demonstrates possibility. The "guerrilla gardening" movement that emerged in New York's Lower East Side in the 1970s, the DIY bike lanes painted by advocates in cities worldwide, the unauthorized crosswalks and public seating installations—each represents an index case that, if successful, generates secondary transmission.

The transmission mechanism operates through multiple vectors. Visual documentation, increasingly through social media, allows interventions to achieve exposure far beyond their immediate geographic context. A photograph of a pop-up plaza in San Francisco can inspire imitation in Seoul within days. Planning conferences and professional networks serve as super-spreader events, concentrating individuals with both the motivation and capacity to implement similar interventions in their home contexts. Publications like *Tactical Urbanism: Short-term Action for Long-term Change* by Mike Lydon and Anthony Garcia function as explicit transmission guides, encoding successful interventions into replicable formulas.

Critical to understanding tactical urbanism's spread is the concept of **legitimacy contagion**. Each successful intervention lowers the barrier for subsequent attempts—not merely by providing proof of concept but by shifting the perceived boundaries of acceptable action. When New York City's Department of Transportation began officially supporting tactical interventions under Janette Sadik-Khan's leadership, it didn't merely implement new projects; it transmitted a legitimacy signal that cascaded through municipal governments worldwide. Suddenly, activities that had been guerrilla actions became sanctioned policy tools.

The mutation rate in tactical urbanism is notably high. Unlike genetic evolution, where high mutation rates typically indicate instability, memetic mutation in urban interventions often signals healthy adaptation. The "Better Block" concept, originating in Dallas, has been implemented in hundreds of cities, but rarely in identical form. Each implementation inherits the core DNA—temporary transformation of a street segment to demonstrate pedestrian-priority potential—while adapting to local conditions, materials, and political contexts. This adaptive mutation is not a weakness but a strength, allowing the meme to colonize diverse urban ecosystems.

Selection pressures in tactical urbanism operate at multiple levels. At the intervention level, projects that successfully demonstrate improved safety, increased foot traffic, or enhanced community satisfaction are more likely to be documented, shared, and imitated. At the municipal level, cities with political cultures amenable to experimentation, strong civil society organizations, and media environments that celebrate innovation are more susceptible to infection. At the global level, economic pressures, climate imperatives, and shifting cultural attitudes toward car dependency create selection gradients that favor certain types of interventions over others.

The temporal dynamics of tactical urbanism spread follow patterns familiar from epidemiology. Initial adoption is slow, limited to innovator cities with particularly favorable conditions. As the legitimacy signal strengthens and documentation accumulates, adoption accelerates exponentially through a growth phase. Eventually, saturation effects emerge as most susceptible municipalities have either adopted the practice or demonstrated immunity. The current state of tactical urbanism suggests we are transitioning from exponential growth to something approaching endemic equilibrium—the practice has become a standard tool in the urban planning repertoire rather than a revolutionary novelty.

### The Parklet Meme: Anatomy of a Viral Urban Form

No single tactical intervention has achieved the global penetration of the parklet—the conversion of one or more parking spaces into miniature public parks, typically through the installation of platforms, seating, and vegetation. The parklet's success as a meme offers a masterclass in the properties that enable urban ideas to achieve viral spread.

The parklet originated in San Francisco in 2005, when the design collective Rebar installed the first "PARK(ing)" installation: a temporary park in a metered parking space, complete with sod, a bench, and a potted tree. The intervention was explicitly designed as art and commentary, calling attention to the disproportionate allocation of public space to private vehicle storage. It was also, crucially, designed to be photographed. The visual contrast between the expected occupant (a car) and the actual installation (a park) created an immediately legible message that translated across cultural and linguistic boundaries.

The memetic payload of the parklet is densely packed. In a single installation, it carries and transmits multiple component ideas: that parking spaces represent contested public space; that streets can accommodate uses beyond vehicle movement and storage; that urban quality of life can be improved through modest interventions; that citizens have agency to reshape their environments. Each of these component memes has its own transmission history, but the parklet bundled them into a single, visually compelling package that could be replicated with minimal resources.

The spread of the parklet meme follows a distinctive two-stage pattern. In the first stage, guerrilla installations proliferate, often as part of the annual PARK(ing) Day event (itself a meticulously designed transmission vehicle). These temporary interventions function as probes, testing local receptivity and generating media coverage that normalizes the concept. In the second stage, municipalities formalize parklet programs, creating permit processes that transform the guerrilla action into sanctioned policy. San Francisco's official Pavement to Parks program, launched in 2010, became a template that other cities could adopt wholesale, complete with design guidelines, permit applications, and implementation manuals.

The parklet's mutation patterns reveal important principles of memetic adaptation. As the concept spread, it acquired local flavors: the "streateries" of COVID-era New York, the "parklets" of San Francisco, the "street gardens" of Melbourne, the "pocket parks" of London. Some mutations emphasized dining space; others prioritized vegetation; still others focused on art installation or community programming. The core DNA—reclaiming car space for human use—remained stable while peripheral features varied widely.

Competitive dynamics shaped parklet evolution. Early parklets competed primarily against default parking space allocation, a battle they won through sheer visibility and charm. As parklets proliferated, they began competing against each other for attention, adoption, and funding. This intra-meme competition drove elaboration and refinement: parklets became more ambitious, more designed, more integrated with adjacent businesses and programming. The selection environment rewarded innovation while the replication mechanism preserved successful variations.

The parklet's success also illuminates the importance of **fitness indicators** in memetic transmission. A parklet is not merely functional; it is visually distinctive, photographable, and clearly artificial. It signals the values and capabilities of those who installed it. Municipalities that adopt parklet programs demonstrate innovation, citizen-responsiveness, and prioritization of public space—signals that attract businesses, residents, and further investment. This signaling function creates self-reinforcing adoption dynamics: parklets spread partly because adopting them broadcasts desirable institutional characteristics.

The parklet meme has now reached a stage of evolutionary maturity where it faces new selection pressures. Critiques have emerged regarding equity—parklets often appear in already-affluent neighborhoods, potentially accelerating gentrification—and regarding privatization of public space, as business-adjacent parklets effectively extend private commercial territory into the public realm. These critiques represent selection pressures that may drive the next round of parklet evolution, favoring variants that address equity concerns or resist commercial capture.

### Superblock Adoption: The Diffusion of Radical Urban Surgery

If the parklet represents memetic evolution at the scale of the parking space, Barcelona's superblocks (*superilles*) operate at the scale of the urban organ. The superblock concept—clustering nine city blocks into a single unit with through-traffic restricted to peripheral streets and interior space reclaimed for pedestrians, cyclists, and public life—represents a more radical intervention that nevertheless has achieved remarkable global transmission.

The superblock did not emerge from guerrilla activism but from professional planning discourse, specifically the work of Salvador Rueda and the Barcelona Urban Ecology Agency beginning in the 1990s. Yet its spread follows recognizably memetic patterns, demonstrating that cultural evolution in cities operates through institutional channels as well as activist networks.

The transmission of the superblock concept accelerated dramatically following the implementation of the first full-scale superblock in the Poblenou neighborhood in 2016. Media coverage, academic papers, and planning tourism created intensive transmission events. Barcelona became a pilgrimage site for urban planners worldwide, much as Freiburg had become for sustainable transportation advocates a generation earlier. The city actively promoted its innovation, understanding that global attention reinforced local political support and attracted further investment in urban transformation.

The superblock's spread reveals the importance of **packaging** in memetic transmission. The concept could have been communicated in various ways: as traffic management, as public health intervention, as climate adaptation, as urban design philosophy. Barcelona's packaging emphasized multiple benefits simultaneously—air quality, noise reduction, traffic safety, public space creation, economic revitalization—creating a message that resonated with diverse audiences and political coalitions. This multi-benefit framing allowed the superblock to find hosts across the political spectrum, from environmental advocates to business associations to public health officials.

Global adoption has proceeded unevenly, shaped by local conditions that determine susceptibility to the superblock meme. Cities with grid-based street networks—themselves the product of earlier memetic transmission—have structural advantages in superblock implementation. High density, mixed use, and existing pedestrian culture create favorable conditions. Conversely, cities organized around arterials and cul-de-sacs, or with deeply entrenched car-dependent lifestyles, have proven more resistant.

The superblock has mutated significantly as it has spread. Vienna's "Supergrätzl" adapts the concept to Austrian political and physical contexts. Paris's "15-minute city" (*ville du quart d'heure*) shares DNA with the superblock but emphasizes accessibility of daily needs over traffic management. Melbourne's "20-minute neighborhoods" represent another variant, optimized for Australian conditions. Each adaptation preserves the core insight—that the fundamental unit of urban planning should be larger than the block but smaller than the district, organized around human rather than vehicular scales—while adjusting peripheral features.

The superblock's spread also illustrates **resistance mechanisms** in urban memetic transmission. Opposition has emerged from predictable sources: parking interests, some business owners, residents accustomed to car access. More interesting is the cultural resistance—the meme complex of automobility that has achieved such deep infection in modern societies that alternatives struggle for conceptual space. The superblock succeeds not merely by offering functional benefits but by presenting a counter-narrative sufficiently compelling to displace incumbent ideas about urban mobility and public space.

Political transmission dynamics shape superblock adoption. Left-leaning city governments have proven more susceptible, but the concept has also spread to center-right administrations attracted by economic revitalization benefits or public health arguments. The COVID-19 pandemic created a punctuated equilibrium moment, temporarily weakening resistance and accelerating adoption as cities sought rapid ways to expand public space and facilitate physical distancing. Whether pandemic-era superblock implementations will persist and replicate remains an open question in real-time memetic observation.

### Ritual Design for Secular Cities: Creating Meaning in Urban Time

Cities are not merely spatial configurations but temporal ones. The rhythm of days, weeks, seasons, and years shapes urban experience as profoundly as the arrangement of streets and buildings. In religious societies, shared ritual provided this temporal structure: the call to prayer, the sabbath, the festival calendar. Secular cities face a distinctive challenge: how to create shared temporal meaning without shared metaphysical commitment.

The emergence of "ritual design" in urban planning represents an attempt to address this challenge through intentional creation of recurring events and experiences that punctuate urban time with collective meaning. Unlike traditional planning, which focuses primarily on space, ritual design operates in the temporal dimension, creating moments that recur with sufficient regularity to become anticipated, prepared for, and remembered.

Consider the spread of "open streets" events, which close roads to traffic and open them to pedestrians, cyclists, and various activities. Beginning with Bogotá's Ciclovía in 1974, which closes over 70 miles of streets every Sunday, the concept has spread to hundreds of cities worldwide. The Ciclovía is not merely a transportation intervention but a secular ritual—a weekly moment when the city's ordinary patterns are suspended and a different mode of inhabitation becomes possible. The spreading of this ritual follows memetic patterns, but what spreads is not just a practice but a temporal structure, a way of organizing urban time around recurring collective experience.

Night markets, critical mass bike rides, first Fridays art walks, restaurant weeks, light festivals—secular cities have generated a proliferating ecology of recurring events that function analogously to religious observance. Each creates anticipated moments of collective experience, shared reference points that structure urban memory and community identity. The design of these rituals involves careful attention to timing, frequency, spatial setting, and sensory experience—the same variables that traditional religious practice has refined over millennia.

The memetic spread of secular urban rituals follows distinctive patterns. Unlike physical interventions, which can be photographed and immediately comprehended, rituals must be experienced to be fully transmitted. This creates a transmission challenge: how does a city learn about a ritual that it cannot directly observe? Documentation helps, but the transmission of ritual requires something more—either direct experience by visitors who then become carriers, or sufficient detailed description that recipients can reconstruct the experience locally.

Successful ritual memes tend to share certain characteristics. They are **modular**, with separable components that can be adopted independently or in combination. They are **scalable**, adaptable from neighborhood to city-wide implementation. They are **generative**, creating contexts for participant-contributed content rather than prescribing fixed experiences. And they are **photogenic**—despite the experiential nature of ritual, visual documentation remains crucial for transmission, creating a selection pressure for rituals that generate compelling imagery.

The design of secular urban rituals also involves careful attention to what might be called **sacred architecture**—not in the religious sense but in the sense of creating spatial and temporal conditions that elevate ordinary experience into something memorable and meaningful. The closing of a street is not itself meaningful; meaning emerges from what happens in that closed street, from the visual transformation, the change in soundscape, the altered social interactions that become possible. Effective ritual design understands this distinction and optimizes for the production of meaningful experience, not merely the creation of opportunity for it.

Competition among secular rituals for urban attention creates selection pressures that shape their evolution. In cities with proliferating event calendars, rituals compete for participant time, volunteer energy, and municipal support. This competition rewards distinctiveness, timing optimization (avoiding conflicts with competing events), and community embeddedness. Rituals that successfully build constituencies—participants who anticipate them, advocate for them, and mourn their absence—achieve the political durability necessary for long-term survival.

### Art as Organ Health Indicator: The City's Expressive Diagnostics

In biological organisms, certain processes serve as reliable indicators of systemic health: pulse, temperature, immune response, inflammatory markers. The living city similarly produces indicators that, properly interpreted, reveal the state of urban health—and among the most sensitive of these indicators is artistic production and expression.

Art functions as an urban health indicator through multiple mechanisms. First, the **presence and diversity of artistic activity** reflects underlying conditions that also predict other health outcomes: economic vitality sufficient to support cultural production, social tolerance that permits unconventional expression, public space available for display and performance, educational institutions that cultivate artistic practice. A city with thriving arts is likely a city with functional economies, intact social fabric, and adequate public infrastructure.

Second, the **content of artistic expression** provides direct feedback on urban conditions. Street art, public installations, performance, and community theater do not merely reflect urban reality but interpret it, making visible conditions that might otherwise escape notice. A proliferation of art addressing housing displacement, environmental degradation, or social alienation signals the presence of these stressors, often before they appear in official statistics. Art functions as an urban nervous system, transmitting signals about local conditions to broader awareness.

Third, **artistic decline or displacement** serves as an early warning of urban pathology. When artists leave a neighborhood, when galleries close, when street art is systematically removed, when venues become unaffordable—these are symptoms that warrant attention. Artists, with their combination of sensitivity to environmental conditions and relative economic vulnerability, function as indicator species, their presence or absence revealing conditions that affect the broader urban ecosystem.

The memetic dimension of art as health indicator involves the spread of diagnostic concepts themselves. The idea that artistic vitality signals urban health is itself a meme, one that has achieved wide transmission among planners, policymakers, and community advocates. This meta-level transmission creates selection pressures: cities that understand the diagnostic value of art may invest in artistic infrastructure not merely for aesthetic reasons but as a strategy for maintaining urban health.

Public art programs represent institutionalized attempts to cultivate artistic health indicators. The "percent for art" policies that dedicate a fraction of construction budgets to public art, the cultural districts and designated arts zones, the artist housing and studio programs—these interventions reflect understanding that artistic vitality requires cultivation and that its presence generates broader benefits. The spread of these policies follows memetic patterns, with cities observing and imitating successful programs from elsewhere.

The diagnostic value of art also creates problematic dynamics. When artistic presence becomes valued as a development indicator, art risks instrumentalization—valued not for itself but for its signaling function. The frequently observed pattern of artist displacement, in which artists colonize affordable neighborhoods, make them desirable, and are subsequently priced out, represents a kind of diagnostic exploitation: using artists as signal generators without commitment to their ongoing presence. Sustainable cities must develop more sophisticated approaches that maintain artistic health without merely extracting its indicator value.

Contemporary urban art increasingly addresses the urban organism directly, creating works that visualize city systems, critique urban processes, or propose alternative arrangements. Projects that map pollution flows, visualize displacement patterns, or document ecological conditions represent art functioning explicitly as diagnostic tool. This self-conscious diagnostic function represents an evolution in the relationship between art and urban health—from passive indication to active examination.

### Conclusion: Toward an Evolutionary Urban Practice

The cases examined in this chapter—tactical urbanism, parklets, superblocks, secular rituals, and artistic indicators—share a common feature: they reveal urban transformation as a fundamentally cultural and evolutionary process. Cities do not change through the implementation of master plans designed by omniscient planners; they evolve through the generation, transmission, variation, and selection of urban ideas.

This evolutionary perspective has practical implications. It suggests that effective urban practice should focus less on designing optimal solutions and more on creating conditions for productive evolution: low barriers to experimentation, diverse idea generation, efficient transmission mechanisms, and selection environments that favor beneficial variations. The tactical urbanist's temporary intervention, the parklet's reversibility, the superblock's pilot implementation—these are not compromises but evolutionary strategies, generating variation that selection can act upon.

Understanding urban change as memetic evolution also provides perspective on the pace of transformation. Biological evolution requires generations; cultural evolution can operate within years. But even cultural evolution faces constraints: existing meme complexes resist displacement, transmission requires compatible carriers, and selection pressures are shaped by entrenched interests. Patient, persistent effort to shift selection environments—through changed incentives, new metrics, altered narratives—may ultimately achieve more than heroic attempts at revolutionary transformation.

The living city, understood as cultural organism, is not a machine to be engineered or a garden to be designed but an evolving system to be cultivated. The urban practitioner becomes less the master planner and more the evolutionary gardener: planting diverse seeds, creating conditions for growth, removing obstacles to healthy development, and accepting that outcomes will reflect not just intention but the unpredictable dynamics of evolutionary process.

The spread of urban transformation will not be engineered; it will be memetic. The future city is already emerging, not in master plans but in the countless experiments, adaptations, and transmissions through which urban ideas find their way from mind to mind, place to place, evolving as they travel into forms not yet imagined by any single human consciousness. Our task is not to predict this future but to participate in its evolution—contributing ideas worthy of transmission, creating conditions that favor beneficial selection, and maintaining the humility appropriate to participants in a process that exceeds any individual understanding or control.
