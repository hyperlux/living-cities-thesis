# Chapter: Financing Living Cities

## The Money Question That Changes Everything

Every vision of a better city eventually collides with the same blunt question: how do we pay for it? The most elegant designs, the most participatory governance structures, the most ecologically sensitive plans—all remain fantasies without financing mechanisms that can translate intention into construction, aspiration into actual buildings where people live.

But the money question is deeper than it first appears. It's not simply about finding sufficient capital, though that matters enormously. It's about what kinds of capital, flowing through what channels, governed by what logics, serving what interests, and operating over what time horizons. The financing mechanisms a society chooses shape the cities that result as surely as architectural styles or zoning codes.

Conventional real estate finance operates according to a particular logic: maximize returns to capital over relatively short time horizons, externalize social and environmental costs wherever possible, and extract value from communities rather than building it. This logic has produced the cities we have—the unaffordable housing, the displacement of longtime residents, the neighborhoods designed for speculation rather than habitation, the infrastructure that enriches developers while impoverishing municipalities.

Financing living cities requires different logic entirely. It means patient capital willing to accept modest returns over long periods. It means community ownership structures that keep wealth circulating locally rather than extracting it to distant shareholders. It means public investment that captures the value it creates rather than gifting it to private landowners. It means risk-sharing arrangements that distribute burdens and benefits more equitably than conventional markets allow.

This chapter explores the emerging ecosystem of alternative financing mechanisms that make different kinds of cities possible. From community development financial institutions to social impact bonds, from municipal bond innovations to land value capture schemes, these tools represent a quiet revolution in how we can fund urban transformation. None is perfect. Each carries its own limitations, contradictions, and potential for co-optation. But together, they offer pathways beyond the false choice between predatory private capital and inadequate public budgets.

## Community Development Finance: Building Local Capital Ecosystems

### The CDFI Revolution

Community Development Financial Institutions represent one of the most successful experiments in alternative finance over the past half-century. Born from the recognition that conventional banks systematically neglect low-income communities and communities of color, CDFIs have grown into a significant force channeling capital to places and projects that traditional finance ignores.

The numbers tell part of the story. By 2023, the CDFI sector in the United States comprised over 1,400 certified institutions managing more than $450 billion in assets. These institutions—which include community development banks, credit unions, loan funds, and venture capital funds—have financed millions of affordable housing units, thousands of community facilities, and tens of thousands of small businesses in underserved communities.

**Self-Help Credit Union** in North Carolina exemplifies what CDFIs can accomplish. Founded in 1980 with a commitment to creating ownership opportunities for those excluded from conventional finance, Self-Help has grown to manage over $2.5 billion in assets while maintaining its mission focus. The credit union has financed more than 90,000 home loans, enabling homeownership for families who would have been rejected by conventional lenders—not because they couldn't repay, but because they didn't fit conventional risk models.

What makes Self-Help's approach distinctive is its willingness to lend on different terms than profit-maximizing institutions. Lower down payments, flexible credit requirements, extensive counseling and support—these features cost money and reduce returns. But Self-Help's mission isn't return maximization; it's community building. And its default rates have remained manageable precisely because it invests in borrower success rather than simply extracting payments.

### The Mechanics of Community Development Lending

CDFIs operate in what financial theorists call "market gaps"—spaces where conventional finance fails to meet legitimate needs. These gaps exist because private markets, left to their own devices, systematically underprice risk in some areas (leading to bubbles and crashes) while systematically overpricing risk in others (leading to capital deserts).

Low-income communities represent the largest capital desert. Banks find it unprofitable to maintain branches in poor neighborhoods, to underwrite small loans to small businesses, to provide mortgages for modest homes in weak markets. The fixed costs of due diligence and servicing make small transactions unattractive regardless of actual risk levels.

CDFIs address these gaps through several mechanisms:

**Below-market capital sources**: CDFIs access capital at rates lower than their cost of funds through government programs (like the CDFI Fund, which has distributed over $5 billion since 1994), foundation program-related investments, and bank investments made to satisfy Community Reinvestment Act obligations. This cheaper capital allows CDFIs to lend at rates affordable to their target communities while still covering costs.

**Technical assistance integration**: Unlike conventional lenders who simply accept or reject applications, CDFIs often provide extensive technical assistance to borrowers before, during, and after loans. This assistance—business planning help, financial coaching, homeownership counseling—reduces default risk while building community capacity.

**Patient loss tolerance**: Because CDFIs aren't accountable to shareholders demanding quarterly returns, they can accept higher loss rates than conventional lenders while maintaining long-term sustainability. A 3% loss rate that would be unacceptable to a commercial bank might be entirely appropriate for a CDFI whose mission is serving high-need borrowers.

**Relationship-based underwriting**: CDFIs often maintain closer relationships with borrowers than conventional lenders, allowing them to identify and respond to problems before they become defaults. This labor-intensive approach costs more per loan but produces better outcomes.

### Community Land Trust Financing

Community land trusts represent a particular financing challenge because their model—permanently affordable homeownership through separation of land and building ownership—doesn't fit conventional mortgage templates. Most banks historically refused to finance CLT homes because they couldn't understand how a mortgage would work when the homeowner owned only the building while the trust retained land ownership.

CDFIs have been crucial in developing CLT financing solutions. **Boston Community Capital**, for example, created specialized mortgage products for CLT homebuyers that address the unique aspects of shared equity ownership. These products recognize that while CLT homeowners have limited upside potential (they can't capture full market appreciation), they also have significant downside protection (the CLT often provides support during financial difficulties rather than immediately foreclosing).

The Champlain Housing Trust in Vermont—the nation's largest CLT—has developed relationships with multiple CDFIs that understand its model. These relationships have enabled financing for thousands of permanently affordable homes while demonstrating that CLT mortgages actually perform better than conventional mortgages in terms of default rates. The stability that community ownership provides translates into financial stability for borrowers.

### The Limits of CDFIs

For all their accomplishments, CDFIs remain marginal players in American finance. Their $450 billion in assets sounds impressive until compared to the $23 trillion held by commercial banks. CDFIs have proven that alternative financing is possible, but they haven't transformed the mainstream financial system.

Several structural factors limit CDFI scale:

**Dependence on subsidy**: Most CDFIs cannot survive on lending income alone. They require ongoing subsidy—from government grants, foundation support, and bank CRA investments—to cover the costs of technical assistance and absorb higher-than-conventional losses. This subsidy dependence limits growth to the availability of philanthropic and government resources.

**Mission drift pressures**: As CDFIs grow, they face constant pressure to "professionalize" in ways that move them toward conventional banking. The skills required to manage a billion-dollar institution differ from those needed to maintain deep community relationships. Many CDFIs that grew rapidly lost their distinctive character.

**Regulatory complexity**: CDFIs must navigate multiple regulatory frameworks depending on their structure—banking regulations for banks, credit union rules for credit unions, securities law for loan funds. This complexity creates compliance costs that constrain growth and innovation.

**Limited equity access**: Most CDFIs are structured as nonprofits or cooperatives that cannot access conventional equity capital markets. They depend on debt and deposits, limiting their ability to absorb losses and take risks.

Despite these limitations, CDFIs demonstrate that community-accountable finance is possible at significant scale. They serve as proof of concept for a different relationship between capital and community.

## Impact Investing: The Promise and Peril of Aligned Capital

### The Impact Investment Thesis

Impact investing emerged from a simple insight: trillions of dollars sit in investment portfolios whose owners would prefer to do good while earning returns, if they could. If this capital could be directed toward social and environmental objectives while still generating financial returns, it could transform the resource landscape for social change.

The Global Impact Investing Network estimates that impact investing assets under management exceeded $1.2 trillion by 2022, with the market growing at approximately 30% annually. This capital flows into affordable housing, renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, healthcare access, financial inclusion, and dozens of other areas where social benefit and financial return might align.

In the housing sector, impact investment has enabled developments that conventional finance would never touch. **Jonathan Rose Companies**, for example, has raised over $3 billion in impact capital for green, affordable, and mixed-income housing developments. Their investors—foundations, family offices, institutional investors—accept returns below what they might earn in purely commercial real estate in exchange for verified social impact.

The **Turner Impact Capital** portfolio demonstrates impact investing at scale. With over $2 billion in assets, Turner has acquired and preserved more than 10,000 affordable housing units that might otherwise have been converted to market-rate housing. Their thesis is that modest but stable returns from affordable housing can satisfy patient capital while preventing displacement of low-income tenants.

### Mechanisms and Structures

Impact investments in housing take various forms:

**Subordinated debt**: Impact investors often provide debt that sits below senior bank loans in the repayment hierarchy. This subordination makes the senior debt safer, enabling banks to provide larger loans at better rates. The impact investor accepts higher risk and lower returns in exchange for enabling projects that otherwise couldn't happen.

**Equity with concessionary returns**: Some impact investors provide equity capital while accepting returns below market rates. A foundation's program-related investment might expect only 2% annual returns rather than the 12-15% that commercial equity would demand. This "patient equity" transforms project economics, making affordable rents financially sustainable.

**Loan guarantees**: Rather than investing directly, some impact investors guarantee loans made by others. This guarantee reduces risk for primary lenders, enabling them to extend credit they otherwise wouldn't. The MacArthur Foundation's window guarantee program, for example, has enabled billions in lending by guaranteeing a portion of losses.

**First-loss capital**: Impact investors sometimes take the "first loss" position in a capital stack, meaning their capital absorbs losses before other investors are affected. This protection induces more risk-averse capital to participate, expanding the total pool of resources.

### Real Examples: Housing Impact in Action

The **Bay Area Transit-Oriented Affordable Housing Fund** (TOAH) demonstrates how impact investment can serve specific urban objectives. This $50 million fund, capitalized by foundations, banks, and public agencies, provides predevelopment and acquisition financing for affordable housing near transit stations. By enabling rapid site acquisition before prices spike, TOAH helps ensure that transit investments benefit existing communities rather than merely accelerating their displacement.

**Enterprise Community Investment** has channeled over $60 billion into affordable housing over four decades through various impact investment structures. Their investors range from major banks seeking CRA credit to foundations making program-related investments to insurance companies seeking stable, long-term returns. This capital has supported over 700,000 affordable homes.

In the community land trust sector, **Grounded Solutions Network** has worked to connect CLTs with impact investors who understand and value the permanent affordability model. Their efforts have helped CLTs access capital sources beyond traditional philanthropy and government grants.

### The Problem with Impact Investing

Impact investing's rapid growth obscures significant tensions within the field. The fundamental challenge is whether financial return and social impact actually align in most circumstances, or whether apparent alignment masks hidden compromises.

**Impact washing**: As impact investing has grown fashionable, many conventional investments have been relabeled as "impact" without meaningful change in practice. A market-rate housing development might claim "impact" status simply by including a few affordable units or installing solar panels. This dilution degrades the meaning of impact claims.

**Measurement challenges**: Measuring social impact proves far harder than measuring financial returns. How do we quantify the impact of a home remaining affordable? Of a family not being displaced? Of a community maintaining stability? The metrics that impact investors use often capture only fragments of true impact, and sometimes the most measurable outcomes aren't the most important ones.

**Return expectations that distort**: When impact investors expect market-rate or near-market-rate returns, projects must be structured to deliver those returns. This often means targeting populations that aren't the most in need (working-class rather than very low-income) or locations where appreciation provides upside (gentrifying rather than distressed neighborhoods). The logic of return expectations shapes what impact investments can accomplish.

**Missing the deeply affordable**: Impact investment has been most successful in workforce housing—affordable to families earning 60-80% of area median income. For the deeply affordable housing needed by very low-income families, impact investment returns simply don't pencil. These populations still depend primarily on government subsidy.

**Co-optation risk**: As impact investing mainstreams, it risks becoming merely a more palatable packaging for capital that operates according to conventional extractive logic. The language of impact provides reputational benefits without requiring fundamental changes in practice.

Despite these critiques, impact investing has demonstrably expanded resources for housing that conventional finance ignores. The question is whether the field can maintain mission integrity while growing, or whether growth inevitably compromises mission.

## Social Impact Bonds: Pay-for-Success Financing

### The SIB Innovation

Social Impact Bonds—also called Pay-for-Success contracts—represent one of the most innovative and controversial financing mechanisms of recent decades. The basic idea is elegant: private investors provide upfront capital for social programs, government pays investors back (with returns) only if the programs achieve specified outcomes, and if programs fail, investors lose their capital rather than taxpayers bearing the cost of failure.

The first SIB launched in 2010 at Peterborough Prison in the United Kingdom, targeting recidivism reduction. Investors provided £5 million to fund rehabilitation programs. If recidivism among program participants fell at least 7.5% compared to a control group, the government would repay investors with returns up to 13%. The program succeeded, and investors received their payments.

Since then, hundreds of SIBs have launched worldwide, addressing homelessness, early childhood education, workforce development, criminal justice reform, and healthcare. In housing, SIBs have funded permanent supportive housing programs that provide stable homes and wraparound services to chronically homeless individuals.

### The Denver Supportive Housing SIB

The Denver Social Impact Bond, launched in 2016, exemplifies housing-focused pay-for-success contracting. The program provided permanent supportive housing to 250 chronically homeless individuals with high public service costs—frequent emergency room visits, jail stays, shelter use, and other expensive interventions.

Private investors—including foundations and impact investors—provided $8.6 million in upfront capital. Denver agreed to pay investors back with up to 20% returns if the program achieved specified outcomes: reduced jail days, reduced emergency service use, and housing stability.

Results exceeded expectations. Participants spent 30% fewer days in jail, made 39% fewer emergency room visits, and achieved 77% housing stability after one year. Denver made success payments to investors while still saving money overall through reduced emergency service costs. The apparent win-win-win validated the SIB model: investors earned returns, government saved money, and homeless individuals gained stable housing.

### The Massachusetts Chronic Homelessness SIB

Massachusetts launched a larger SIB in 2014 targeting 500 chronically homeless individuals. With $3.5 million from investors including United Way and the Calvert Foundation, the program provided housing and intensive services over six years.

The program achieved significant housing stability—over 90% of participants remained housed—and demonstrated reductions in emergency services use. Success payments compensated investors while the state achieved net savings compared to the counterfactual of continued homelessness.

### Critiques and Complications

Despite apparent successes, SIBs have attracted significant critique:

**Transaction costs**: Structuring SIBs requires extensive negotiation among multiple parties—government, investors, service providers, and evaluators. Legal, financial, and evaluation costs can exceed $1 million per SIB, costs that might have simply been spent on direct services.

**Outcome measurement problems**: Determining whether a program "worked" requires comparison to what would have happened without the program—a counterfactual that can never be directly observed. Different evaluation methodologies produce different conclusions, creating opportunities for manipulation.

**Perverse incentives**: When payment depends on measurable outcomes, programs face pressure to focus on outcomes that are measurable rather than outcomes that matter, and to select participants most likely to show measured improvement—a practice called "creaming."

**Privatization concerns**: SIBs shift financial risk from public to private actors, but they also give private actors influence over public program design. Some critics argue that SIBs represent an inappropriate marketization of social services.

**Limited scale**: Despite a decade of development, SIBs remain tiny relative to social needs. The complexity of structuring deals limits replication, and many SIBs haven't demonstrated clear superiority over conventional program funding.

**Returns to wealth**: Even "successful" SIBs channel public funds to investors as returns. Progressive critics ask why wealthy investors should profit from reducing homelessness—a social problem whose persistence partly reflects policy choices that benefit the wealthy.

Defenders argue that SIBs at least bring new resources into social programs, shift risk away from taxpayers, and create rigorous outcome measurement that conventional programs often lack. The debate continues, with SIBs remaining a small but notable part of the housing finance landscape.

## Crowdfunding for Housing: Democratizing Investment

### The Promise of the Crowd

Crowdfunding platforms have transformed how people raise money for everything from medical bills to artistic projects. In housing, crowdfunding offers the tantalizing possibility of democratizing real estate investment—allowing ordinary people to invest small amounts in local developments rather than leaving real estate finance to wealthy individuals and large institutions.

The theoretical appeal is substantial. If a neighborhood could collectively invest in local developments, residents might gain returns that otherwise flow to distant investors. Community investment might create accountability that absentee ownership lacks. And the process of crowdfunding—telling a project's story, engaging potential investors—might build social capital alongside financial capital.

### Platform Examples

**Fundrise**, launched in 2012, was among the first real estate crowdfunding platforms. Initially focused on commercial real estate, Fundrise has expanded to over $2.9 billion in assets under management, allowing individuals to invest as little as $10 in diversified real estate portfolios. While most Fundrise investments are market-rate commercial properties, the platform demonstrates that small-dollar real estate investment is technically feasible.

**Groundfloor** focuses on single-family residential loans, allowing individuals to invest in fix-and-flip and construction loans starting at $10. While not specifically focused on affordable housing, Groundfloor demonstrates the mechanics of crowdfunded real estate debt.

**Small Change** explicitly targets impact real estate, allowing investments in projects that generate social and environmental benefits alongside returns. Investors can put as little as $250 into specific developments—a mixed-use building in a disinvested neighborhood, affordable housing in a transit corridor—and receive returns if projects succeed. Small Change has funded dozens of projects totaling over $100 million.

**CommunityFirst** represents the community investment model most explicitly. Rather than extractive returns, CommunityFirst enables community members to lend to local developments at modest interest rates, keeping the benefits of development circulating locally.

### Challenges and Limitations

Crowdfunding for housing faces significant obstacles:

**Regulatory complexity**: Securities laws designed to protect investors also limit who can invest in what. While regulations have loosened somewhat (through Regulation Crowdfunding and Regulation A+), compliance costs remain substantial.

**Risk disclosure and sophistication**: Real estate investment carries significant risks that unsophisticated investors may not understand. Platforms must balance accessibility against investor protection.

**Scale limitations**: Most crowdfunding platforms require substantial equity from conventional sources; crowd investments typically represent only a small portion of total capital. This limits the transformative potential of community investment.

**Return expectations**: Investors—even impact-oriented ones—expect returns. In weak markets where community investment is most needed, generating returns while maintaining affordability may be impossible.

**Accountability questions**: When hundreds or thousands of investors own fractional interests in a development, meaningful accountability becomes challenging. Who speaks for the crowd?

Despite these limitations, crowdfunding has added to the toolkit for financing community-oriented development. The sector remains young, and innovations continue to emerge.

## Municipal Bonds: Public Finance for Public Purposes

### The Power of Tax-Exempt Debt

Municipal bonds represent the primary mechanism through which American localities finance infrastructure, and they play a crucial role in housing finance. When municipalities or housing authorities issue tax-exempt bonds, they can borrow at rates substantially below what private developers pay, because investors accept lower yields in exchange for avoiding federal income tax on interest.

This tax subsidy is enormous. Over the life of a 30-year bond, tax exemption might reduce borrowing costs by 30% or more compared to taxable debt. For housing, this means significantly lower financing costs that can translate into lower rents.

### Housing Revenue Bonds

Housing Finance Agencies in every state issue tax-exempt bonds to finance affordable housing. These agencies take various forms—some are state agencies, others quasi-independent authorities—but all leverage federal tax subsidy to reduce housing costs.

**California Housing Finance Agency (CalHFA)** has issued tens of billions in bonds to support affordable homeownership and rental housing. Their mortgage revenue bonds fund below-market-rate mortgages for first-time homebuyers. Their multifamily bonds finance affordable rental developments.

**New York City Housing Development Corporation (HDC)** represents perhaps the most active municipal housing bond issuer in the country. HDC has financed over 200,000 affordable housing units through bond issuance, leveraging the city's strong credit rating to access capital on favorable terms.

The mechanics work as follows: HDC issues bonds backed by expected revenues from housing projects (rent payments, mortgage payments, or government subsidies). Because bond interest is tax-exempt, investors accept lower rates. These savings flow through to lower financing costs for developments, enabling lower rents than purely private financing would allow.

### Green and Social Bonds

Recent innovations have added impact dimensions to municipal bonds. Green bonds finance environmentally beneficial projects—renewable energy, energy efficiency, sustainable transportation. Social bonds finance projects with explicit social objectives.

In housing, **sustainability bonds** combine green and social objectives, financing affordable housing that also achieves environmental standards. The World Bank and European Investment Bank pioneered these instruments, and American municipal issuers have followed.

**Massachusetts** issued the first social bond explicitly labeled as such in 2020, with proceeds supporting affordable housing and homelessness services. The **New York City Comptroller's Office** has developed frameworks for social bond issuance to ensure proceeds genuinely serve social objectives rather than merely bearing attractive labels.

The growth of ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) investing has increased investor appetite for labeled bonds, potentially reducing borrowing costs for issuers who meet ESG criteria. This creates incentives for municipalities to structure bond issues around impact objectives.

### Limitations of Municipal Bonds

Municipal bonds carry significant limitations for transformative housing finance:

**Federal tax expenditure benefits wealth**: Tax exemption benefits investors in high tax brackets most. The municipal bond subsidy is ultimately a federal tax expenditure that disproportionately benefits wealthy bondholders.

**State and local credit constraints**: Not all localities can issue bonds on favorable terms. Cities with poor credit ratings, or rural areas with limited tax bases, cannot access municipal bond markets as effectively as wealthy cities.

**Revenue requirements**: Revenue bonds must be backed by income streams that cover debt service. Deeply affordable housing—serving tenants who can afford minimal rent—doesn't generate sufficient revenue to support bond financing without additional subsidy.

**Conservative practices**: Municipal bond markets evolved conservative practices that can limit innovation. Bond counsel, rating agencies, and institutional investors often resist unfamiliar structures, even beneficial ones.

Despite these limitations, municipal bonds remain essential to affordable housing finance, channeling tens of billions annually into housing production and preservation.

## Land Value Capture: Reclaiming Public Value

### The Unearned Increment

Henry George, the 19th-century economist, made an observation that remains powerful: land values rise not primarily because of anything landowners do, but because of what communities do around them. When a transit line opens, nearby land values increase—not because landowners built the transit, but because public investment made their location more desirable. When a neighborhood improves through collective effort, landlords benefit from rising rents they didn't create.

George called this increase the "unearned increment" and argued that taxing it would simultaneously fund public investment and reduce speculation. His ideas—though never fully implemented anywhere—have influenced urban economics for over a century.

Land value capture refers to the family of mechanisms that attempt to capture some portion of publicly-created land value for public purposes. When done well, these mechanisms can fund infrastructure, reduce speculation, and improve affordability simultaneously.

### Tax Increment Financing

Tax Increment Financing (TIF) represents the most common land value capture mechanism in American practice. The basic idea: when a designated area is improved (through infrastructure investment, redevelopment, etc.), property values rise, generating increased property tax revenue. This "increment"—the additional tax revenue above the base level—is captured and reinvested in the district rather than flowing to general municipal coffers.

TIF has financed billions of dollars of urban redevelopment. **Chicago's TIF districts** have captured over $5 billion in property tax increment since the 1980s, funding infrastructure, economic development, and some affordable housing. **Portland, Oregon** has used TIF extensively to finance transit-oriented development, including affordable housing near transit stations.

The mechanics vary by state, but typically:
1. A municipality designates a TIF district and establishes a "base" property tax level
2. The municipality or private developers make improvements in the district
3. Property values rise, generating increased property tax revenue
4. The increment (revenue above base) is dedicated to TIF purposes for a fixed period (often 20-30 years)
5. After the TIF period expires, full property taxes flow to general municipal funds

### TIF Critiques

TIF has attracted substantial criticism:

**School funding diversion**: In many states, TIF diverts property taxes that would otherwise fund schools. Critics argue that TIF effectively subsidizes developers at the expense of education.

**Counterfactual uncertainty**: TIF assumes that increased property values result from TIF investments. But in growing cities, values might have risen anyway, meaning TIF captures windfall that would have occurred regardless.

**Capture by interests**: TIF districts are often established through processes vulnerable to developer influence. When developers effectively determine TIF boundaries and expenditures, the mechanism serves private rather than public interests.

**Regressive impacts**: TIF often subsidizes developments in areas already attractive to investment, while neglected neighborhoods that most need public investment receive nothing.

**Lack of transparency**: TIF funds often flow through special authorities with limited democratic accountability, making it difficult for citizens to understand how their property taxes are being used.

### Other Value Capture Mechanisms

Beyond TIF, various mechanisms attempt to capture land value:

**Special assessment districts**: Property owners in defined areas pay additional assessments to fund improvements that benefit them specifically. This mechanism has funded everything from street lighting to transit to affordable housing.

**Inclusionary zoning fees**: When jurisdictions allow increased development density, they can require affordable housing contributions—either in-kind units or fees—as a condition. This captures a portion of the value that zoning creates.

**Community benefit agreements**: Developers seeking project approvals negotiate with community groups, committing to affordable housing, local hiring, or other benefits in exchange for community support.

**Ground rent systems**: As practiced by community land trusts and some public land authorities, separating land and building ownership allows the community to retain land value while residents own improvements. Singapore's public land system captures land value comprehensively, with the government owning 90% of land and leasing it for development.

**Land value tax**: A tax on land value alone (not improvements) captures unearned increment while encouraging development. No American jurisdiction uses a full land value tax, but some cities (like Pittsburgh historically) have taxed land more heavily than buildings.

### International Examples

International examples demonstrate more aggressive value capture:

**Hong Kong's rail + property model**: The Mass Transit Railway Corporation finances transit construction partly through rights to develop land around stations. This captures the value that transit creates for surrounding land, reducing public subsidy needs.

**Singapore's comprehensive land system**: Government ownership of most land, combined with leasehold development rights, allows capture of land value appreciation through lease adjustments. This has funded extensive public housing that houses 80% of the population.

**São Paulo's CEPACs**: Brazil's largest city auctions development rights in designated areas, with proceeds dedicated to infrastructure and social investment in those areas. This mechanism captures a portion of value created by zoning changes.

These examples demonstrate that more comprehensive value capture is possible, though each operates within distinctive political and legal contexts not easily transplanted.

## Patient Capital: The Time Dimension of Finance

### Why Time Horizons Matter

Perhaps no aspect of finance shapes cities more than time horizons. Capital seeking quick returns requires strategies that generate quick returns: speculation, value extraction, rent maximization. Capital willing to wait can afford strategies that build value over time: community investment, relationship-based stewardship, incremental improvement.

Patient capital—investment willing to accept modest returns over extended periods—represents a crucial resource for living cities. The most beneficial development approaches often require decades to reach full potential. Community land trusts that permanently steward affordability. Infrastructure investments whose benefits accrue over generations. Neighborhood improvements that compound over time.

### Sources of Patient Capital

**Foundation endowments** represent trillions of dollars invested according to fiduciary standards that typically prioritize market returns. But growing movements encourage foundations to align endowment investment with mission. When the Ford Foundation commits $1 billion from its endowment to mission-related investments, or when the Heron Foundation invests 100% of its endowment for impact, substantial patient capital becomes available for housing and community development.

**Pension funds** manage trillions on behalf of workers who will retire decades hence. This long time horizon theoretically aligns with patient investment strategies. Labor-affiliated housing investment trusts (like the AFL-CIO Housing Investment Trust) direct union pension capital into affordable housing, accepting modest returns in exchange for creating union construction jobs and community benefit.

**Insurance companies** have liability structures requiring stable, long-term investment. Life insurance companies in particular need assets that match multi-decade liability horizons. Affordable housing—with its stable, predictable income streams—can serve this need. **Prudential** has invested over $1 billion in affordable housing through its social investments program.

**Religious institutions** often bring ethical commitments and long time horizons to investment. The **Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility** coordinates religious investors seeking social impact. Catholic religious orders, Quaker meetings, and other faith institutions have invested in community development for decades.

**Family offices** managing wealth for multigenerational families sometimes prioritize impact alongside return. When a family commits to preserving wealth across generations, speculation becomes less attractive than stable, sustainable investment.

**Government capital** can be the most patient of all, accepting returns that accrue over decades or even generations. Singapore's housing investment, accumulated over half a century, demonstrates what truly patient public capital can accomplish.

### Building Patience into Finance

Several mechanisms can extend effective time horizons:

**Long-dated instruments**: Structuring investments with very long maturities (30, 50, even 99 years) forces patient orientation. Community land trust ground leases running 99 years ensure land remains in community ownership across generations.

**Locked capital structures**: Investment vehicles that cannot be easily liquidated—closed-end funds with long terms, restricted redemption provisions—prevent impatient capital from destabilizing long-term strategies.

**Perpetual ownership structures**: Organizations like CLTs, community development corporations, and cooperative federations are designed to exist permanently, not to exit. This perpetual orientation aligns with patient capital needs.

**Returns tied to long-term outcomes**: Structuring returns to depend on outcomes that only manifest over decades (community stability, health outcomes, environmental improvement) encourages patient approaches.

### The Political Economy of Patience

Patient capital is not just a technical category but a political one. Capital is impatient partly because our economic system makes it so—quarterly earnings reports, annual bonus cycles, short-term stock price movements. Creating space for patient capital requires pushing against these structural pressures.

This is why public policy matters so much. When government provides patient capital directly—through deeply subsidized housing finance, long-term infrastructure investment, permanent funding streams—it creates the conditions for patient development that private markets alone cannot sustain.

The greatest accomplishments in affordable housing have come from sustained public commitment over decades: Vienna's social housing built over a century, Singapore's public housing program spanning 60 years, the American public housing program before disinvestment began. Patient public capital, accountable to democratic processes rather than return requirements, remains essential to housing the most vulnerable populations.

## Integrating Financing Mechanisms: Toward a System

### The Limits of Individual Tools

Each financing mechanism described in this chapter can contribute to living cities, but none is sufficient alone. CDFIs remain marginal in scale. Impact investing struggles with measurement and mission drift. SIBs are complex and small. Crowdfunding is fragmented. Municipal bonds require credit and revenue. Value capture depends on political will. Patient capital is scarce.

The challenge is integration—weaving these mechanisms together into systems that can finance transformation at scale.

### Layered Capital Stacks

Complex affordable housing developments often combine multiple financing sources in layered capital stacks. A typical project might include:

- Senior debt from a bank or CDFI
- Subordinated debt from impact investors
- Tax credit equity from LIHTC syndicators  
- Soft debt from government programs
- Grants from foundations
- Deferred developer fee
- Ground lease with a community land trust

This layering allows each capital source to serve its appropriate role, with risk and return matched to investor requirements. But it also creates tremendous complexity. The transaction costs of assembling layered capital stacks often absorb resources that could otherwise serve housing directly.

### System-Building Strategies

Building more effective financing systems requires attention to several dimensions:

**Standardization and simplification**: While every project has unique characteristics, more standardized financing approaches could reduce transaction costs. Shared legal templates, streamlined due diligence processes, and consistent documentation could accelerate deployment.

**Intermediary development**: Effective intermediaries—like CDFIs, housing finance agencies, and impact investment funds—translate between capital sources and development projects. Strengthening these intermediaries builds system capacity.

**Pipeline development**: Financing is useless without viable projects to finance. Building development capacity—training developers, supporting predevelopment, streamlining approvals—creates pipelines that can absorb available capital.

**Data infrastructure**: Better information about what works—which financing structures, which program designs, which outcome metrics—enables learning and improvement. Shared data infrastructure across the sector could accelerate innovation.

**Policy advocacy**: Many financing limitations reflect policy choices that could be changed. Tax policy, banking regulation, securities law, housing programs—all shape what financing mechanisms are possible. Advocacy for enabling policies is itself a form of system-building.

### The Public Role

Ultimately, the financing mechanisms described in this chapter operate at the margins of housing systems dominated by conventional private finance and government programs. CDFIs, impact investors, crowdfunding platforms—all together represent only a small fraction of total housing investment.

Truly transforming housing finance requires policy change that reshapes incentives throughout the system. This could include:

- Expanding public housing investment directly
- Requiring affordable housing contributions from all market-rate development
- Taxing speculation and capturing land value appreciation
- Redirecting Federal Reserve support toward housing affordability
- Creating public development entities that compete with private capital
- Establishing housing as a human right with corresponding entitlements

These larger transformations require political power that alternative financing alone cannot create. Finance follows power; it does not create it. The mechanisms explored in this chapter are tools that can be used—effectively or not—depending on the political and social context in which they operate.

## Conclusion: Finance in Service of Life

The question we began with—how do we pay for living cities?—admits no simple answer. There is no magic financing mechanism that will make affordability pencil without subsidy, that will align profit motives with community benefit, that will transform real estate from wealth extraction to wealth creation for all.

What we have instead are tools—imperfect, partial, contested tools—that can expand what's possible when combined with political will and community organization. Community development financial institutions prove that lending can build communities rather than extract from them. Impact investing demonstrates that some capital will accept below-market returns for verified impact. Social impact bonds experiment with aligning payment and outcomes. Crowdfunding opens small-scale participation in development finance. Municipal bonds channel tax-subsidized capital toward public purposes. Land value capture attempts to reclaim publicly-created wealth. Patient capital provides the time horizons that genuine community building requires.

None of these mechanisms resolves the fundamental tensions between capital and community. They operate within—not against—the logics of property and profit that produce housing crises in the first place. They can make things better at the margins, but they cannot by themselves transform housing from commodity to right.

That transformation requires politics, not just finance. It requires power capable of reshaping the rules of the game, not just playing more skillfully within existing rules. The financing mechanisms explored here are resources in that larger struggle—tools that can support communities building power and implementing alternatives when opportunities arise.

Living cities require living finance—money that circulates in service of community rather than extracting from it, capital that builds shared wealth rather than concentrating it, investment that nurtures the slow growth of community capacity over generations rather than demanding quick returns. The mechanisms exist to move in this direction. The question is whether we can build the political will to use them at the scale our crises demand.

The money for living cities exists. It sits in pension funds and foundation endowments, in insurance company portfolios and government treasuries, in the collective savings of communities that could invest in their own futures. The challenge is not scarcity but direction—channeling existing resources toward life rather than extraction, toward building rather than speculation, toward the patient work of creating cities where all can thrive.

This is not primarily a technical problem, though technical innovation helps. It is a political problem that requires political solutions. The financing mechanisms described in this chapter are tools for that political work—not substitutes for it.
