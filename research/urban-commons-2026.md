# Urban Commons Movement 2025-2026: Deep Dive Research

## Executive Summary

The urban commons movement represents a fundamental reimagining of city governance, property relations, and participatory democracy across Europe. This research documents concrete policies, participation rates, and institutional innovations in five key cities: Bologna, Barcelona, Naples, Berlin, and Milan.

## 1. BOLOGNA: The Regulation on Urban Commons (Regolamento sui beni comuni urbani)

### Historical Context
Bologna pioneered the urban commons regulatory framework in **February 2014**, becoming the first Italian city to formally recognize citizen care of common goods through a legal instrument.

### The Bologna Regulation
- **Official Title**: "Regolamento sulla collaborazione tra cittadini e amministrazione per la cura e la rigenerazione dei beni comuni urbani" (Regulation on collaboration between citizens and administration for the care and regeneration of urban commons)
- **Adopted**: February 22, 2014
- **Legal Basis**: Article 118, paragraph 4 of the Italian Constitution (principle of horizontal subsidiarity)

### Key Institutional Innovations

#### Patti di Collaborazione (Collaboration Pacts)
The regulation introduces "patti di collaborazione" – formal agreements between citizen groups and the municipality for:
- Care of urban green spaces
- Regeneration of abandoned buildings
- Management of cultural spaces
- Maintenance of public infrastructure

#### Labsus (Laboratorio per la sussidiarietà)
- **Founded**: 2005 (operational momentum post-2014)
- **Role**: Research laboratory, documentation center, and advocacy organization for shared administration
- **Current Activities**: As of February 2026, hosts the second edition of the "Festival dell'Amministrazione Condivisa" (March 26-28, 2026, Assisi)
- **Annual Report**: "Rapporto Labsus" documents pacts nationally

### Diffusion Data (as of 2025-2026)
- **Over 280 Italian municipalities** have adopted similar regulations based on the Bologna model
- The model spread internationally to other European cities
- Labsus documents ongoing "storie di patti" (stories of collaboration pacts) demonstrating practical implementation

### Theoretical Framework
- Based on the **Rodotà Commission** definition of beni comuni (common goods): goods that express utilities functional to the exercise of fundamental rights and the free development of the person
- Emphasizes **diritto d'uso** (right of use) over proprietary rights
- Implements "diritto alla città" (right to the city) as articulated by Henri Lefebvre

## 2. BARCELONA: Decidim Platform

### Platform Overview
**Decidim** ("Let's Decide" / "We Decide" in Catalan) is Barcelona's participatory democracy platform combining:
- Free and open-source software (FOSS)
- Technopolitical community organizing
- Hybrid digital-physical participation

### Hard Data

#### Establishment & Governance
- **Created**: 2016 by Barcelona City Council
- **Derived from**: 15M anti-austerity movement (Spain 2011)
- **License**: GNU AGPLv3 (code), CC BY-SA (content), Open Database License (data)
- **Trademark Transfer**: 2019 – Barcelona City Council transferred control to Decidim Association

#### Participation Statistics
- **Initial Trial (Pre-2017)**: 40,000 citizens participated over 2 months
- **Participant Breakdown**: ~40% of 39,000 individual participants via face-to-face; ~85% of organizational participants via face-to-face
- **Proposals**: ~11,000 submitted, ~8,000 accepted
- **Budget Monitoring**: 90% of Barcelona City Council's 2016-2019 budget tracked through participatory processes

#### Metadecidim Community (as of June 2023)
- **~5,000 registered participants** in the meta-governance community

#### Global Adoption (2022-2023 estimates)
- **311 instances** running Decidim in Spain and 19 other countries (Borge et al., 2022)
- **80 local/regional governments + 40 citizens' associations** in Spain and elsewhere (Borges et al., 2022)
- **400+ city and regional governments and civil society institutions** using Decidim (Decidim's own estimate, 2023)
- **2023**: Recognized as Digital Public Good by Digital Public Goods Alliance

#### Technical Specifications
- **Software**: Ruby on Rails
- **Current Version**: 0.31.0 (November 20, 2025)
- **Participatory Spaces** (6 types): Processes, Assemblies, Conferences/Meetings, Initiatives, Consultations
- **Participatory Components** (12 types): Comments, Proposals, Amendments, Votes, Accountability, etc.

### Case Studies

#### Zurich "Quartieridee" / "Stadtidee"
- **Quartieridee (Wipkingen)**: CHF 40,000 participatory budget, 99 proposals, 8 funded
- **Stadtidee (City-level)**: CHF 540,000 participatory budget
- Notable project: Citizens' occupation of lakeside plot owned by Kibag AG

#### Lucerne LuzernNord (2021)
- Top-down implementation found to **strengthen digital divide** rather than overcome it
- Language limitation (German-only) excluded migrant communities
- Researchers found initiative did not achieve "full potential"

### Theoretical Basis
- Explicitly connected to Henri Lefebvre's "Right to the City"
- "Technopolitical" approach: rejects view that software is "value neutral"
- Self-described as "recursively democratic infrastructure"

## 6. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS

### Right to the City (Lefebvre, 1968)
Core concepts influencing all cases:
- Urban space shaped by inhabitants, not only market forces
- "Rescue the citizen as main element and protagonist"
- City as "meeting point for building collective life"

### David Harvey's Elaboration
> "The right to the city is far more than the individual liberty to access urban resources: it is a right to change ourselves by changing the city... The freedom to make and remake our cities and ourselves is... one of the most precious yet most neglected of our human rights."

### Commoning as Process
Contemporary scholarship distinguishes:
- **Common-pool resources** (the shared goods)
- **Community** (those who govern)
- **Commoning** (the practice and process)

"Commoning adds another dimension to the commons, acknowledging the social practices entailed in the process of establishing and governing a commons."

## 7. PARTICIPATORY BUDGETING: COMPARATIVE DATA

### Global Scale (as of 2024)
- **11,500+ municipal PB processes** implemented globally
- Growth from ~1,500 in 2014

### European Examples with Decidim

#### Paris (2023)
- **Budget**: ~€75 million allocated to participatory budgeting

#### Prague (2018)
- Czech municipalities: €3.7 million (0.6% of expenditures)

---

## 8. KEY FINDINGS & TRENDS

### Convergence Patterns
1. **Legal Innovation**: Bologna model spreading across Italy (280+ municipalities)
2. **Digital Infrastructure**: Decidim platform adopted internationally (400+ institutions)
3. **Housing Focus**: Berlin referendum represents largest-scale housing socialization attempt since WWII
4. **Grassroots-Institutional Hybrid**: Naples shows bottom-up recognition; Bologna shows top-down framework creation

### Tensions & Challenges
1. **Digital Divide**: Lucerne case shows top-down digital participation can exclude marginalized groups
2. **Electoral Vulnerability**: PB processes ceased in Badalona after mayor lost power (2018)
3. **Implementation Gap**: Berlin referendum non-binding; requires further political action
4. **Scale vs. Radicalism**: Larger institutional frameworks may dilute transformative potential

### Emerging Developments (2025-2026)
1. **Festival dell'Amministrazione Condivisa** (Assisi, March 2026) - Second edition
2. **Berlin Second Referendum** planning - would be legally binding
3. **Decidim 0.31.0** release (November 2025) - continued platform development
4. **Labsus Rapporto 2024** published - annual documentation of collaboration pacts
