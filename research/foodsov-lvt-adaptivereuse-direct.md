# Food Sovereignty, Land Value Tax, Adaptive Reuse — Direct Research Feb 20

## Food Sovereignty 2025

**Definition (La Via Campesina):**
- "Centrality of small-scale food producers"
- "Accumulated wisdom of generations"
- "Autonomy and diversity of rural and urban communities"
- "Solidarity between peoples"
- Coined at 1996 World Food Summit

**2025 Global Gathering (Sri Lanka Sept 2025):**
- 500+ participants from 80+ countries
- Consolidating common political direction
- Major movement milestone

**Urban Dimension (Indonesia June 2025):**
- "Peasant Cooperatives and Urban Poor Unite for Food Sovereignty"
- Solidarity-based economy
- Food sovereignty + social justice connection

**Movement Status (Resilience June 2025):**
- "Moved from margins to center stage"
- International discussions on food, environment, well-being
- No longer fringe concept

**International Day of Action (October 16):**
- "People's Food Sovereignty"
- Against transnational corporations
- Empowering peasants, Indigenous Peoples, working communities
- Strengthens local and national economies

## Land Value Tax (LVT) & Georgism 2025

**Research Priorities (Progress & Poverty Institute):**
- "Advancing Land Value Taxation"
- 2025 and beyond research agenda
- Growing scholarship on LVT

**Current Implementations:**
- Estonia: National land tax (though facing challenges)
- Various US jurisdictions with split-rate taxation
- Pennsylvania cities with differential rates

**LVT + UBI Connection:**
- Highlighted in Muslim World Report (April 2025)
- "Urgent need for economic reform"
- Addressing inequality and environmental degradation

**Core Principle:**
- Tax land value, not improvements
- Captures socially-created value
- Discourages speculation
- Encourages productive use

**Implementation Challenge:**
- "Would disadvantage people who currently own land"
- Transition issues
- Political resistance

**Alternative Approach:**
- Land leasing (Progress & Poverty Substack)
- "Georgism isn't about land value taxation per se"
- Multiple implementation paths

## Adaptive Reuse 2025

**Office-to-Residential Surge (RentCafe):**
- 2022: 23,100 units
- 2025: 70,700 units (record-breaking)
- ~42% of all adaptive reuse apartments

**CBRE Data:**
- 73 US office conversions completed (2024)
- 309+ planned or underway
- Growing pipeline

**Scale:**
- 169,000 apartments from adaptive reuse projects
- Office conversions nearly half

**Lessons (NAAHQ Oct 2025):**
- "Brings back to life vacant, partially full, foreclosed buildings"
- "Imaginative ways"
- Transforming empty office space

**Challenges (NAIOP):**
- "Applicable to less than 5% of buildings"
- "Typically takes 25% longer"
- Complex technical exercise (Brookings)
- Requires understanding fiscal structure, financial feasibility

**Trend:**
- Newer buildings (1990s-2010s) increasingly converted
- From 1.27% to much higher projected share

## Synthesis: Land + Food + Buildings for Living Cities

| Domain | Current System | Living City System |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Food | Industrial, global | Sovereignty, local |
| Land | Speculative ownership | LVT or community ownership |
| Buildings | Demolish, rebuild | Adaptive reuse first |

**Living City Design:**

1. **Food Sovereignty:**
   - Community food councils
   - Urban-rural linkages
   - Small-scale producer priority
   - Local food systems
   - Against corporate concentration

2. **Land Value Tax:**
   - All land publicly owned or taxed at full value
   - No speculation possible
   - Improvements tax-free
   - Revenue funds community services

3. **Adaptive Reuse First:**
   - No new construction without evaluating reuse
   - Office → housing conversions supported
   - Material banks for building components
   - Deconstruction over demolition

**Metric:**
- % of food from local/regional sources
- % of land value captured for community
- % of construction from adaptive reuse
