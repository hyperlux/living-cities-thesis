# Light Pollution, Urban Trees, Community Gardens — Direct Research Feb 20

## Light Pollution & Dark Skies 2025

**State of the Science (DarkSky International):**
- Annual update capturing research findings
- Thousands of scientific papers distilled
- First released 2022, updated annually
- "Artificial Light at Night: State of the Science 2025"

**Health Impacts (PMC 2026):**
- Street lighting at night linked to:
  - Eye diseases
  - Cardiovascular diseases
  - Mood changes
- "People living in places with limited illuminance declare better health"

**WEF Assessment (March 2025):**
- "Global light pollution is skyrocketing"
- Human health, environment, nature all affected
- "Immediate measures should be taken"
- Limit artificial light in cities and houses

**Costs (SEI Feb 2025):**
- "Lost in the unending glow"
- "Hidden costs of a city that never sleeps"
- Bangkok case study
- Sustainable lighting practices needed

**Solutions:**
- Responsible lighting practices
- Dark Skies initiatives
- Balance illumination with natural nightscape preservation
- Certified dark sky areas

**Key Framing:** Light pollution disrupts sleep, harms health, wastes energy — darker nights are healthier nights.

## Urban Tree Canopy 2025

**Cooling Effect (Nature 2025):**
- "30% increase in tree canopy coverage reduced mean hotspot temperatures by 1.5°C"
- Significant decrease in grids exceeding 29°C
- Heat mitigation measured

**Literature Review (AUF 2025 - 17 citations):**
- Dense, tall canopies provide broad-scale cooling
- Mixed plantings with shrubs/grass enhance local effects
- "Urban Trees and Cooling: A Review of the Recent Literature"

**Predictive Models (Northern Woodlands Summer 2025):**
- "Predicting Urban Tree Cooling at Citywide Scales"
- Trees help with extreme city heat
- Oak, maple, linden for shade and cooling

**Research Advances (ScienceDirect 2025 - 11 citations):**
- Tree canopy cooling efficiency in different local climate zones
- Quantitative basis for optimizing tree planting
- Heat alleviation effects measured

**US Forest Service:**
- "How and where to best maintain and enhance tree canopy"
- Optimize vital ecosystem service
- Rising temperatures context

**Key Framing:** Trees cool cities physically — shade and evapotranspiration create livable spaces.

## Community Gardens 2025

**Systematic Review (Springer July 2025):**
- 37 studies analyzed
- Impact on: food access, urban resilience, community well-being
- Research peaked during COVID-19 pandemic
- Barriers: inequitable access

**Food Security (No Food Gap):**
- "Transforming food access in low-income areas"
- Fresh, nutritious produce
- Building community power
- Historical roots: wartime victory gardens

**Health Outcomes:**
- "Significantly improve food security"
- "Better public health outcomes"
- "Reducing diet-related diseases"
- Community gardens + food security go hand-in-hand

**Multiple Benefits (AGU 2025):**
- Food security
- Job opportunities
- Training
- Social cohesion

**Systematic Literature Review (Nature 2025):**
- "Nurturing resilient cities"
- Focus on increasing food production in urban areas
- Growing food security concerns addressed

**Key Framing:** Gardens provide food, health, community — people growing together.

## Synthesis: Light + Trees + Gardens for Living Cities

| Element | Problem | Living City Solution |
|---------|---------|---------------------|
| Light | Sleep disruption, health | Dark sky design |
| Heat | Urban heat islands | 40%+ canopy cover |
| Food | Insecurity, poor nutrition | Community gardens |

**Living City Design:**

1. **Dark Sky Compliant:**
   - All outdoor lighting downward-facing
   - Warm spectrum only
   - No unnecessary lighting
   - Curfews for non-essential light
   - Preserve circadian rhythms

2. **Urban Forest:**
   - 40%+ tree canopy target
   - Dense, tall canopies for broad cooling
   - Native species preferred
   - Mixed plantings with shrubs
   - Trees in all public spaces

3. **Garden Network:**
   - Community garden in every neighborhood
   - Food forest integration
   - Job creation, training
   - Social cohesion building
   - Equitable access guaranteed

**Metric:**
- Night sky brightness (mag/arcsec²)
- Tree canopy coverage %
- Community garden area per resident
