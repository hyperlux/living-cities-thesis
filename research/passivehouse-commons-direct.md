# Passive House & Commons Governance — Direct Research Feb 20

## Passive House Standard 2025

**Definition:**
- Most rigorous energy efficiency standard
- Heating demand ≤ 15 kWh/m² annually
- 88% better than current building code

**Key Criteria:**
1. Space heating and cooling demand limits
2. Renewable primary energy demand
3. Airtightness (measured via blower door test)
4. Thermal comfort requirements

**EU Trajectory (Energy Commission):**
- 2030: Standard raised from "nearly-zero energy buildings" to "zero-emission buildings"
- All new buildings must meet zero-emission standard

**Comparison (EkoBuilt 2025):**
- Passive House vs Net Zero: "Two excellent home energy standards"
- Passive House = energy efficiency focus
- Net Zero = renewable energy offsets remaining demand
- Both "make abundant sense" as targets

**DOE Efficient New Homes Program:**
- "High-performance home so energy efficient that renewable energy could offset most or all annual energy"
- National framework for efficiency standards

**Academic Analysis (ScienceDirect 2025):**
- "Energy-efficient design aligns with passive house standards"
- Supports sustainability especially in cold climates
- 3 citations in first year

## Commons Governance — Ostrom's Framework 2025

**Core Concept:**
- Polycentricity: "Complex form of governance with multiple centers of decision making"
- Each center operates with some degree of autonomy
- Overlapping decision-making units

**Elinor Ostrom's Legacy:**
- Nobel Prize 2009
- Proved commons can be sustainably managed without privatization OR state control
- "Third way" between market and government

**2025 Applications:**

**IASC Conference (June 2025):**
- "Regenerating the Commons" theme
- Amherst, Massachusetts
- Elinor Ostrom Award continues

**Climate Change Connection:**
- Ostrom & McGinnis (1992): applied commons governance to climate
- Still relevant framework

**Post-Growth + Polycentricity (ScienceDirect 2026):**
- "Polycentric principles enhance coordination across scales"
- "Facilitating growth limitation while preserving democracy"
- Bridge between degrowth economics and governance

**Design Principles for Commons (Ostrom):**
1. Clearly defined boundaries
2. Proportional equivalence (benefits match costs)
3. Collective choice arrangements
4. Monitoring
5. Graduated sanctions
6. Conflict resolution mechanisms
7. Minimal recognition of rights to organize
8. Nested enterprises (for larger systems)

## Synthesis: Efficient Buildings + Commons Governance for Living Cities

**Connection:**

1. **Passive House** = physical infrastructure of efficiency
   - Reduces energy demand 88%
   - Zero-emission target achievable
   - Lower operating costs for residents

2. **Commons Governance** = social infrastructure of sharing
   - Polycentric decision-making
   - Multiple scales of governance
   - Ostrom's 8 principles as design guide

**Living City Application:**

| Aspect | Passive House | Commons Governance |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Energy | Minimal demand | Community-owned supply |
| Land | Efficient site design | CLT ownership |
| Resources | Closed-loop materials | Collective stewardship |
| Decisions | Technical standards | Democratic processes |

**Design Principle:** Every Living City building should:
- Meet Passive House standard (≤15 kWh/m²)
- Be governed by commons principles (Ostrom's 8)
- Nest within larger polycentric system

**Metric:**
- % of buildings meeting Passive House
- Governance polycentricity score (number of nested decision layers)
