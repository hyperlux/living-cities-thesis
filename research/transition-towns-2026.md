## 3. Energy Descent Action Plans (EDAPs)

### Concept
An EDAP is a community-developed plan for transitioning away from fossil fuel dependency, looking "across-the-board at creative adaptations in health, education, economy and much more."

### Notable EDAPs
1. **Kinsale EDAP (2005)** - The original, created by Hopkins' students
2. **Totnes & District 2030 (2010)** - First comprehensive community EDAP, co-authored by Jacqi Hodgson and Rob Hopkins
3. Multiple community EDAPs across UK, Ireland, and internationally

### EDAP Outcomes (Mixed)
**Successes**:
- Provided community visioning framework
- Generated hundreds of local projects
- Created template for other communities

**Limitations**:
- Implementation often partial
- Dependent on sustained volunteer energy
- Many remained aspirational rather than fully enacted
- Local government adoption variable

## 5. What Failed or Struggled

### Structural Challenges

1. **Volunteer Burnout**
   - Heavy reliance on unpaid labor
   - Core organizers often exhausted
   - Sustainability of initiatives dependent on few individuals

2. **Scale Limitations**
   - Remained largely small-town/neighborhood focused
   - Struggle to influence larger urban systems
   - Limited political/policy impact at national level

3. **Demographic Homogeneity**
   - Criticism of being predominantly white, middle-class movement
   - Accessibility barriers for working-class communities
   - Later work on "Just Transition" attempted to address this

4. **Local Currency Failures**
   - Totnes Pound (defunct 2019)
   - Stroud Pound (defunct 2013)
   - Transaction volumes remained marginal
   - Administrative overhead unsustainable

5. **Peak Oil Premise Challenged**
   - Original framing around "peak oil" proved premature
   - Shale revolution extended oil supplies
   - Movement had to reframe around climate change instead

### Critiques

**The Trapese Collective Critique (2008)** - "The Rocky Road to a Real Transition"
- Questioned whether community-level change could achieve systemic transformation
- Debate about role of confrontation vs. positive vision
- Hopkins responded, opening dialogue about theory of change

**Academic Assessments**
- Scholarly work noted "second wave" of municipal climate politics (2006-2015)
- Movement described as linking grassroots with municipal governments
- Questions about scalability and systemic impact

## 9. Assessment: Movement Status 2026

### Strengths
- **Persistence**: 20 years old and still active
- **Global reach**: 67 countries
- **Adaptability**: Evolved framing from peak oil to climate/resilience
- **Infrastructure**: Training, resources, network still functioning
- **Legacy**: Repair cafés, community energy, local food movements normalized

### Weaknesses
- **Scale plateau**: Numbers roughly stable, not growing significantly
- **Aging demographic**: Original activists aging, youth engagement variable
- **Systemic impact**: Limited influence on national/international policy
- **Resource constraints**: Heavy reliance on grant funding

### Overall Assessment
The Transition Towns movement represents a significant experiment in community-led sustainability. Its greatest achievement may be cultural: normalizing local resilience thinking and spawning projects (repair cafés, community energy, local food) that have become mainstream. Its limitation is the gap between community-scale action and the systemic transformation required for climate goals.

Rob Hopkins' shift toward imagination work may reflect recognition that the "doing stuff" model needs complementing with deeper cultural and psychological transformation. The movement persists as infrastructure for community organizing, but has not achieved the breakthrough scale its founders hoped for.
