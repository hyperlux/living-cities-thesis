# Care Economy and Social Reproduction: Deep Dive Research 2025

## Executive Summary

The care economy represents a fundamental pillar of social reproduction—the often invisible labor that sustains life, nurtures human capabilities, and enables all other economic activity. This research documents the emergence of alternative care models including cooperatives, time banks, and mutual aid networks that challenge commodified care through collective ownership, reciprocity, and solidarity.

**Key Metrics:**
- **381 million** care workers worldwide (ILO 2024)
- **748 million** people outside the labor force due to care responsibilities
- **2 billion** potential parents without adequate parental protection
- **24%** gender pay gap in the health and care sector
- **65.7 million** informal and family caregivers in the US alone

The care economy encompasses:
- **Paid and unpaid care work** (direct and indirect)
- **Public and private sectors**, including MSMEs, non-profit organizations
- **Social and solidarity economy** organizations
- Care providers, recipients, employers, and institutions

Care work involves activities and relationships that:

- Foster agency, autonomy, and dignity
- Develop opportunities and resilience for both caregivers and recipients

**Sector Composition:**
- Education and early childhood care
- Health and social sectors
- Domestic work
- Unpaid family and community care

### The Care Crisis: Hard Numbers

**Who Needs Care:**
- 8.36 million people annually receive support from 5 main long-term care services:
  - Home health agencies: 4.74 million
  - Nursing homes: 1.38 million
  - Hospices: 1.24 million
  - Residential care communities: 713,300
  - Adult day service centers: 273,200

- **12 million Americans** needed long-term care in 2007
- 63% are persons aged 65+ (6.3 million)
- 37% are under 64 (3.7 million)
- **68%** lifetime probability of becoming disabled in 2+ ADLs for people 65+
- By 2050: **27 million people** projected to use paid long-term care (doubled from 2000)

**Family Caregiving Labor:**

## 2. Care Cooperatives: Worker-Owned Models

### Overview

Care cooperatives represent a transformative model where caregivers own and democratically control their workplaces, fundamentally altering power dynamics in care provision.

**US Federation of Worker Cooperatives (USFWC)** reports a fast-growing community of worker coops advancing worker ownership across the United States, with the Democracy at Work Institute (DAWI) supporting cooperative development.

### Home Care Cooperatives

**Cooperative Care (Wisconsin)** - Example model:
- Locally owned, worker-run team
- Provides in-home care for seniors, veterans, and people with physical/cognitive disabilities
- Serves Waushara County and surrounding areas
- Mission: Enable people to remain "happy, healthy and safe right at home"

**Key Benefits of Worker-Owned Care Models:**
1. **Higher retention rates** - Workers with ownership stakes stay longer
2. **Quality of care** - Democratic control incentivizes care quality
3. **Living wages** - Surplus returns to workers, not shareholders
4. **Training investment** - Cooperatives invest in member development
5. **Care continuity** - Lower turnover means consistent relationships

### International Cooperative Alliance (ICA) Framework

The ICA defines cooperatives as:
> "Autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically-controlled enterprise."

**Seven Cooperative Principles:**
1. Voluntary and open membership
2. Democratic member control
3. Member economic participation
4. Autonomy and independence
5. Education, training, and information
6. Cooperation among cooperatives
7. Concern for community

### NCBA CLUSA Statistics (2024)

- **65,000** cooperative establishments in the US
- **1 in 3** Americans are cooperative members
- Over 100 years of advancing cooperative business model
- International programs building cooperative capacity across Kenya, Guatemala, Peru, Madagascar, and Timor-Leste

## 3. Time Banking Networks

### What is Time Banking?

Time banks track hours members earn by helping others and hours spent receiving help. **All hours are valued equally**, whether professional services or simple neighborly assistance.

For every hour of help given, a member earns one "time dollar" or "time credit."

### TimeBanks.Org Global Statistics

**Global Reach:**
- **48 countries** have TimeBanks
- **500,000+ members** worldwide
- **35 valued partners**

### Timebanking UK Data (2025)

**Key Metrics:**
- **Hours exchanged to date: 6,805,104**
- **Members: 25,723**
- **Exchanges complete: 342,434**
- **Organisations: 4,439**
- Target: Aiming for **7 million hours**

**Network Examples:**

**New River Valley TimeBank (Virginia, USA):**
- Community-based exchanges
- "All are welcome in whatever way they show up"
- Counter-intuitive approach: "If someone is struggling, we ask THEM to help us"

**Banc del Temps de Sitges (Spain):**
- Part of network of 50+ timebanks established by Asociación Salud y Familia
- Concentrated primarily in Catalonia

**Tai Tokerau Timebank (New Zealand):**
- Located in Whangarei, north of Auckland
- Connected to Aroha Gardens community garden
- Recently reactivated and growing

### Time Banking Mechanisms

- Equal hour valuation democratizes exchange
- Builds social capital alongside economic exchange
- Addresses isolation, particularly among elderly
- Creates reciprocity networks that survive market fluctuations
- Functions as parallel economy during crises
