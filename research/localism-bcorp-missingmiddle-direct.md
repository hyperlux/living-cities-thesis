# Localism, B Corps, Missing Middle Housing — Direct Research Feb 20

## Localism & Subsidiarity 2025

**Localism Manifesto (Resilience Sept 2025):**
- "Commitment to place, supported through decentralization of power, action, economies"
- Empowering localities to experiment with different policies
- "Insulating experiments from being quashed by those at the top"
- Positive alternatives for "angry and radicalized voters"

**Subsidiarity Principle:**
- Not just localism — appropriate level for each decision
- "Level of authority consistent with resolution of a problem"
- Sometimes above local level
- "Unclear decentralization enables local groups to self-organize"

**Frontiers Research (2025):**
- "Subsidiarity as answer to crisis of local self-government"
- Territorial reforms
- Distribution of powers

**Democratic Renewal (Oct 2025):**
- "Democratic renewal begins locally"
- "Transmission belts" connecting participation across governance levels
- Subsidiarity principle applied

**Key Insight:** Localism + subsidiarity = decisions at lowest appropriate level, not just always local.

## Synthesis: Governance + Enterprise + Housing for Living Cities

| Domain | Principle | Living City Application |
|--------|-----------|------------------------|
| Governance | Subsidiarity | Decisions at appropriate level |
| Enterprise | Social integration | Mission-driven businesses |
| Housing | Missing middle | Diverse typologies |

**Living City Design:**

1. **Governance (Subsidiarity):**
   - Neighborhood decisions at neighborhood level
   - City-wide decisions at city level
   - Regional coordination where needed
   - No one-size-fits-all

2. **Enterprise (Beyond B Corp):**
   - Structural social orientation required
   - Worker cooperatives preferred
   - Mission in legal structure, not just certification
   - Community benefit built-in

3. **Housing (Missing Middle):**
   - No single-family-only zones
   - ADUs allowed everywhere
   - Duplexes, triplexes standard
   - Townhomes and courtyard apartments
   - Mixed income by design

**Metric:**
- Subsidiarity score: % decisions at appropriate level
- Enterprise structure: % cooperatives vs B Corps vs traditional
- Housing diversity: Simpson index of housing types
