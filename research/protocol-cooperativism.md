## 1. Exit to Community (E2C) Movement

### Core Concept

Exit to Community offers an alternative to the traditional startup "exit" (acquisition or IPO). Instead, organizations mature toward **community ownership and accountability**.

**Three Pillars:**
1. Business purpose aligned with ownership
2. Founders and investors can "let go" when appropriate
3. Communities can protect the businesses they value

### "Implicit Feudalism" Thesis

Central argument of *Governable Spaces*:
> "Platforms nudge users to tolerate nearly all-powerful admins, moderators, and 'benevolent dictators for life.'... The internet has been plagued by 'implicit feudalism': a bias, both cultural and technical, for building communities as fiefdoms. The consequences... matter far beyond online spaces themselves, as feudal defaults train us to give up on our communities' democratic potential."

## 8. Critical Analysis

### Success Factors for Platform Cooperatives

From P2P Foundation analysis (Neal Gorenflo):

1. **Incubate Templates** - Well-resourced, focused development of legal, financial, organizational structures
2. **Better Service at Competitive Price** - Leverage democratic structure as competitive advantage
3. **Take Cooperation to Next Level** - Deep collaboration vs. traditional competition
4. **Create Wealth Distribution Ecosystem** - Build support infrastructure (universities, social investors, unions)
5. **Build Mass Movement** - Populist, trans-partisan messaging

### Challenges Observed

**Governance Failures:**
- Ampled struggled with funding AND governance before shuttering
- Uniswap: "Accountability remains in doubt" despite decentralization
- Many DAOs maintain implicit hierarchy despite democratic rhetoric

**Economic Sustainability:**
- Resonate couldn't sustain operations
- Many co-ops depend on grant funding
- Scaling remains difficult

**Technical Barriers:**
- Software development is complex
- Interoperability challenges between platforms
- Open source development requires ongoing investment

### The "Implicit Feudalism" Problem

Schneider argues:
> "Platforms nudge users to tolerate nearly all-powerful admins, moderators, and 'benevolent dictators for life'... feudal defaults train us to give up on our communities' democratic potential, inclining us to be more tolerant of autocratic tech CEOs and authoritarian tendencies among politicians."

**Solution pathways:**
- Media archaeology (learning from governance legacies)
- Political theory integration
- Participant observation in democratic experiments
- Tools like PolicyKit, CommunityRule, Decidim

## 9. Key Frameworks

### Metagovernance Definition

Two related roles:
1. **Enabling/constraining** users' ability to create their own institutions
2. **Governing interactions** between separate institutions (chat groups, GitHub communities, blockchain protocols, courts/contracts)

### Solidarity Economy Internet

Schneider & Scholz:
> "The solidarity economy deserves a solidarity Internet... Members of a food cooperative may not notice the contradiction when they keep their files on Google Drive, process their payments with Square, and buy ads on Facebook."
