## 1. Doughnut Economics Cities & Regions

### 1.1 Global Adoption Status (as of 2025-2026)

Since Amsterdam pioneered the City Portrait approach in April 2020, **over 50 local and regional governments worldwide** have formally adopted Doughnut Economics frameworks. A peer-reviewed study published in October 2025 ("Doughnut Economics in Local Government: An Overview of Emerging Practice" - Grcheva & Vianello) provides the first comprehensive analysis of this movement.

**Geographic Distribution:**
- Europe: Amsterdam, Brussels, Barcelona, Copenhagen, Grenoble, Glasgow, Tomelilla (Sweden), Bad Nauheim (Germany), Cornwall, Riga, Valencia Romans
- North America: Portland, Philadelphia, Nanaimo (Canada)
- Asia-Pacific: Ipoh (Malaysia), Melbourne
- Latin America: Mexico City, various Brazilian municipalities
- Africa: Nairobi initiatives

### 1.2 Five Areas of Practical Application

The 2025 research identifies five main ways local governments apply Doughnut Economics:

1. **Data-based diagnostic and monitoring** - Creating "Portraits" of place
2. **Place-wide strategic compass** - Guiding overall policy direction
3. **Sector or project-specific visioning** - Applied to circular economy, housing, mobility
4. **Impact assessment and decision-making** - Evaluating policies through Doughnut lens
5. **Citizen participation and engagement** - Community involvement in portrait creation

## 2. Amsterdam: The Pioneer Model

### 2.1 Implementation History

- **2019**: Series of workshops with Circle Economy, developing circular strategy
- **April 2020**: First City Portrait launched during COVID-19 lockdown
- **2020-2025**: Amsterdam Circular Strategy aims for 100% circularity by 2050, 50% raw material reduction by 2030
- **2025**: Donut & Friends Festival marks 5 years of implementation

### 2.2 What Amsterdam Measures

**The Amsterdam City Portrait uses the "Four Lenses" methodology:**

| Lens | Domain | Scale | Examples of Indicators |
|------|--------|-------|------------------------|
| Local-Social | Social foundations | City residents | Housing affordability, health access, income inequality |
| Local-Ecological | Environmental | City boundaries | Air quality, green space, local biodiversity |
| Global-Social | Social impact elsewhere | Beyond borders | Labor conditions in supply chains, outsourced extraction |
| Global-Ecological | Planetary boundaries | Consumption footprint | CO2 emissions, material footprint, water usage |

**Key Measurement Tools:**
- **Circular Economy Monitor**: Measures environmental and some social impacts of material use - this is how "impact elsewhere" is operationalized
- **"State of the City" Report**: Bi-annual publication by Research & Statistics Department tracking "beyond GDP" indicators
- **Comprehensive Vision Amsterdam 2050**: Long-term spatial planning using "growth within limits" framework

### 2.3 Governance Innovation

- **Amsterdam Doughnut Coalition**: Civil society self-organizing network collaborating with municipality
- **District-level Doughnut projects**: Decentralized implementation (e.g., "Donut Bakery")
- **Cross-departmental integration**: Mobility and spatial planning teams now work with sustainability using Doughnut thinking
- **Decision-making tool**: Under development (2025) to help policymakers apply Doughnut principles
- **Subsidy program**: New funding specifically for initiatives contributing to Doughnut outcomes

## 3. Brussels Capital Region: Economic Transition Model

### 3.1 Unique Approach

Brussels explicitly positioned Doughnut Economics as **the new economic paradigm** to replace GDP-based metrics. Secretary of State for Economic Transition Barbara Trachte drove this adoption.

**Context:**
- Dense region: 162 km², 1.2 million inhabitants
- One of EU's richest regions by GDP, yet 1/3 population at risk of poverty
- Tertiary economy with minimal productive/agricultural activities

### 3.2 The Four-Level Implementation

**Macro Level - Brussels Donut Portrait (2022, updated 2023)**
- Serves as diagnostic tool and compass
- Developed with ICHEC business school and Confluences non-profit
- Uses participatory stakeholder engagement to refine indicators

**Meso Level - Policy Measures ("Shifting Economy" Strategy 2022-2030)**
- Introduced "social and environmental exemplarity" requirement
- **2024**: Bonus incentives for exemplary businesses
- **2030**: Regional support exclusively for exemplary businesses
- Regional investment bank transformed to finance only exemplary businesses
- Only exemplary R&D projects receive funding

**Micro Level - Organization Support**
- BrusselsDonut team runs workshops for companies, NGOs, administrations
- No "ready-made solution" - each entity adapts the model

**Nano Level - Individual Consumption**
- Four Lenses applied to everyday objects
- Helps conscious consumption choices

## 7. Degrowth Principles & Pilot Programs

### 7.1 Core Degrowth Concepts

Degrowth is increasingly referenced alongside Doughnut Economics (Barcelona notes the concepts are "closely linked"). Key elements:

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Sufficiency** | Fair share of resources for basic needs within ecological limits |
| **Care** | Valuing reproductive/subsistence work; equitable care distribution |
| **Justice & Distribution** | Fair treatment within/across generations and geographies |
| **Autonomy & Democracy** | Collective self-determination free from domination |
| **Decommodification** | Reducing market logic in all life spheres |
| **Commoning** | Collective governance of resources independent of private ownership |
| **Convivial Technology** | Accessible, shared, repairable, not controlled by experts |

### 7.2 Municipal Implementation Challenges

Barcelona explicitly notes: "The concept is closely linked to degrowth, which is not yet on the agenda in some circles."

**Tensions observed:**
- Political coalitions may resist degrowth framing
- Lack of concrete business transformation success stories
- Difficulty financing alternative projects

## 8. Commons-Based Governance Examples

### 8.1 Amsterdam Commons Economy

**Afrikaanderwijk Cooperative** (Amsterdam) demonstrates commons principles:
- Residents and entrepreneurs organize collective power, influence, ownership
- Operates between market (extraction) and government (top-down)
- Residents "determine, own, and decide for themselves"
- Value remains where it originates in community
- Ownership redistribution for fair economy

**AmsterDOEN Initiative:**
- Strengthens collaborations between community initiatives
- Creates legal and financial space for community economy
- Develops tools to strengthen community economic models

### 8.2 P2P Foundation: Commons Transition Framework

The P2P Foundation's **Commons Transition** policy proposals outline:
- Open Knowledge Commons Society
- Policy frameworks for commons-based production
- Peer-to-peer economic organization

### 8.3 Manifesto for Economy of the Commons

Marieke van Doorninck (former Amsterdam Deputy Mayor) champions:
- Community initiatives deserve more recognition
- Commons create "much more value than what we consider the regular economy"
- Need for policy frameworks supporting commons-based production

## 9. Measurement Gaps & Challenges

### 9.1 Identified Limitations

**From Brussels:**
- Political support/coherence essential but challenging with coalition governments
- Need for concrete business transformation success stories
- Lack of operational tools for implementing transformative ideas
- Resource/financing constraints

**From Amsterdam:**
- Still need to improve connecting social and climate aspects internally
- Takes significant time to build awareness and working capacity
- Initially siloed in Sustainability Department - now expanding

**From Barcelona:**
- Indicator selection dependent on participants' interests
- Differences between expert and citizen perspectives
- Concept still not well-known; difficult to build participation
- Association with degrowth creates resistance

### 9.2 What's NOT Being Measured (Well)

- **Supply chain social impacts**: Limited operationalization of "global-social" lens
- **Care economy contributions**: Undervalued in existing metrics
- **Commons value creation**: No standard accounting methods
- **Sufficiency indicators**: Difficult to measure "enough"
- **Democratic participation quality**: Beyond formal metrics
