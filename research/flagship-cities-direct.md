# Flagship City Models — Direct Research Feb 20

## Vienna Social Housing — THE GOLD STANDARD

**Coverage:**
- ~60% of Vienna's population lives in municipal or subsidized housing
- 100 years of social-democratic tradition
- Infrastructure built by AND for citizens

**Recent Status (2025):**
- Target: 5,500 new Gemeindebau apartments by 2025
- Challenge: New rental construction dropped 60% from 2024 to 2025
- Only ~1,800 new rental apartments expected in 2025

**Key Features:**
- Public rental model
- Strict rent controls
- Residency security
- Clear allocation criteria
- Mixed-income neighborhoods (no "projects")

**Why It Works:**
- Long-term political commitment (100 years)
- Land banking by city
- Cross-subsidization from market rents
- Maintenance as permanent obligation

## Barcelona Superblocks — SCALING SUCCESS

**The Model:**
- 3x3 grid of existing city blocks
- Vehicle traffic pushed to perimeter
- Interior becomes pedestrian/green space
- Reverses distribution of public space from vehicles to people

**Results (2025):**
- First three superblocks showed environmental and health improvements
- Air pollution reduction
- Noise reduction  
- Traffic accident reduction
- Increased green space access
- Quality of life improvements documented (BMC Public Health study Jan 2025)

**Expansion:**
- Now "desirable and broadly celebrated as good places to live"
- Model expanded to other areas of Barcelona
- Plans to turn all major avenues into walking areas
- "Barcelona has visibly and palpably changed" — NetZeroCities Nov 2024

**Integration:**
- Part of broader 2015 Superblock programme
- Connected to climate adaptation strategy
- Trees and green infrastructure tempering Mediterranean climate

## Singapore — TECHNOLOGY-INTENSIVE MODEL

**Food Security (30by30):**
- Original: 30% food self-sufficiency by 2030
- Revised: 20% fibre / 30% protein by 2035 (acknowledging challenges)
- S$234M invested across programs

**Results:**
- Eggs: SUCCESS — 528M → 773M pieces, ~34% self-sufficient
- Vegetables: STRUGGLING — production down 33%, only 3% self-sufficient
- Seafood: DECLINING — production down 34%, only 6% self-sufficient

**Model:**
- High-tech vertical farming
- Multi-story farms
- Capital-intensive
- Government-coordinated

## Detroit — POST-INDUSTRIAL TRANSFORMATION

**Urban Farming:**
- Beaverland Farms: 4-acre production farm on 37 city lots
- Three-farm cooperative network
- 60% of Brightmoor is vacant land (~15,000 acres potential)
- Urban Agriculture Division established 2023
- $240K in grants shared by 9 farmers/collectives
- Detroit Black Farmer Land Fund for BIPOC land ownership

**Model:**
- Community-organized
- Vacancy-based (using abandoned land)
- Evolving toward cooperative ownership
- Land trusts emerging

## Medellín — SOCIAL URBANISM

**Transformation:**
- From "most dangerous city in world" to globally celebrated
- Cable cars connecting marginal hillside communities
- Green corridors cooling streets
- Social inclusion integrated into planning

**Results:**
- Improved inclusion
- Cut poverty
- Slashed trip times
- Quality of life improvements

**Caveats (Feb 2026):**
- Inequality persists beneath success narrative
- Gentrification accelerating
- Tourism-driven displacement rising

## Comparative Patterns

| City | Core Strategy | Coverage | Key Challenge |
|------|--------------|----------|---------------|
| Vienna | Social housing | 60% population | New construction declining |
| Barcelona | Street reclamation | Expanding | Political continuity |
| Singapore | High-tech food | Struggling | Cost, scale limits |
| Detroit | Vacancy utilization | Emerging | Capital, organization |
| Medellín | Infrastructure access | Visible transformation | Displacement |

**What Scales:**
1. Long-term political commitment (Vienna: 100 years)
2. Land ownership/banking (Vienna, Detroit CLTs)
3. Spatial transformation (Barcelona, Medellín)
4. Mixed-income design (Vienna: no "projects")

**What Struggles:**
1. Capital-intensive tech without subsidy (Singapore farming)
2. Success without anti-displacement (Medellín)
3. Short political cycles (Madrid Observatorio retracted)
