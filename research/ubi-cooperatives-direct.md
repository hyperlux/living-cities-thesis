## Key Patterns

1. **UBI works when long-term** — Kenya shows guarantee enables investment, not just consumption

2. **Lump sums > regular payments** for business formation

3. **Platform coops need institutional support** — Up&Go succeeded with Sunset Park Family Center backing

4. **Coops survive crises** — Up&Go grew post-COVID

5. **Different models for different goals** — Stocksy (revenue), Up&Go (jobs), CoopCycle (federation)

6. **Worker ownership changes behavior** — More investment, more care, more maintenance
