| Traditional Parking | Robotaxi Era |
|--------------------|--------------|
| Parking garages in CBD | Peripheral charging depots |
| Surface lots | Potential redevelopment |
| Street parking | Curb management for pickup/dropoff |
| Residential garages | Reduced for non-car-owning households |

### Urban Form Impacts

**Potential Positive Scenarios:**
- Reduced parking requirements in zoning codes
- More developable land in urban cores
- Reduced impervious surface area
- More housing/commercial density possible

**Potential Negative Scenarios:**
- Induced demand increasing VMT (vehicle miles traveled)
- Sprawl encouragement (easier to live far from work)
- "Zero occupancy" miles during repositioning
- Congestion from slow-moving robotaxis

**Research Findings:**
- Mixed predictions on congestion impact
- Kearney predicts negative impact due to induced demand
- Other studies suggest positive impact vs. private car ownership
- Studies on road safety show mixed results vs. human drivers

## 7. What Failed (Lessons from Cruise)

### Root Causes of Cruise Failure

1. **Safety Incident Management**
   - Failure to immediately disclose full details of October 2023 pedestrian incident
   - DMV cited lack of transparency

2. **Premature Scaling**
   - Pushed for 24/7 permits before technology ready
   - 5,000-vehicle fleet goal unrealistic given incident rate

3. **Public Relations Failures**
   - Multiple viral videos of stuck vehicles
   - Emergency vehicle interference incidents
   - Coning protests demonstrated vulnerability

4. **Leadership/Culture**
   - Quinn Emanuel report cited "deficient leadership"
   - CEO resignation following scandal
   - Insufficient safety culture

5. **Regulatory Overconfidence**
   - Assumed regulatory approval = operational readiness
   - San Francisco's opposition underestimated

6. **Business Model Challenges**
   - $561M quarterly losses unsustainable
   - Revenue targets unrealistic
   - Parent company (GM) facing own pressures

### Broader Industry Failures

**Companies that scaled back AV ambitions:**
- Ford (2022)
- Volkswagen (2022)
- Uber ATG (sold to Aurora 2021)
- Otto (shuttered 2018)
- Apple Car Project (various pivots)

**Common Themes:**
- Underestimated complexity of urban driving
- Overpromised timelines ("fully autonomous by 2018")
- Insufficient regulatory engagement
- Safety incidents derailed progress

## 8. Regulatory Landscape

### U.S. Federal

**Current State:**
- No unified federal framework
- NHTSA investigations for specific incidents
- SAE J3016 levels widely adopted as reference
- State-by-state permits create fragmentation

**Pending:**
- Waymo lobbying for federal uniform standards
- February 2026: Waymo testified to Senate Commerce Committee
- Company argues U.S. will lose trillion-dollar global market to China without reduced regulation

### State Variations

| State | Regulatory Approach |
|-------|---------------------|
| Arizona | Most permissive; early leader |
| California | Comprehensive permit system (DMV + CPUC) |
| Texas | Generally permissive |
| Nevada | Friendly to testing and deployment |
| New York | Restrictive; significant lobbying ($1.8M since 2019) |

### International

**Japan:**

## 9. Future Outlook (2025-2026)

### Near-Term Expectations

**Waymo:**
- Continued geographic expansion
- 1 million rides/week target
- International launches (Tokyo, London)
- Zeekr vehicles at scale

**Zoox:**
- Remove San Francisco waitlist by 2026
- Commercial pricing introduction
- Austin and Miami launches

**Tesla:**
- Robotaxi product launch (timing uncertain)
- Vision-only approach under scrutiny

**Baidu:**
- Continued Chinese market dominance
- Potential international expansion

### Key Uncertainties

1. **Regulatory evolution:** Federal standards? More incidents triggering restrictions?
2. **Safety record:** Will 85% crash reduction claim hold at scale?
3. **Consumer adoption:** Can trust barrier be overcome?
4. **Transit integration:** Competition or complement?
5. **Land use impacts:** Will cities actually reduce parking requirements?
6. **Labor implications:** Job losses for drivers (taxi, ride-hail, trucking)

### Bottom Line

Autonomous mobility has arrived as a commercial reality in select urban markets, led decisively by Waymo. However, the path to profitability, widespread adoption, and positive urban outcomes remains uncertain. The Cruise failure demonstrates that technological capability alone is insufficient—operational discipline, regulatory relationships, safety culture, and public trust are equally critical. Cities should prepare for AV integration while maintaining investments in transit and micromobility as complements rather than treating robotaxis as silver bullets for urban transportation challenges.
