# Low Traffic Neighborhoods, Heat Pumps, Third Places — Direct Research Feb 20

## Low Traffic Neighborhoods (LTNs) 2025

**Definition:**
- Residential areas bordered by main roads
- Through-traffic removed via strategic bollards/planters
- "Only people driving in are those who need access"

**Evidence (Guardian May 2025):**
- "LTNs improve people's lives"
- Collisions and injuries reduced significantly
- "Do not increase on surrounding roads" (countering criticism)

**NYC Application (Open Plans):**
- "Perfect for New York City"
- Residential streets too narrow for nonlocal traffic
- "Reclaim neighborhoods by making small changes"
- Prioritize local use

**Academic Analysis (ScienceDirect 2026):**
- Perceptions and lived experience studied
- Bollards and planters at key locations
- Purpose: remove through-traffic

**Legal Victory (BBC Jan 2026):**
- Tower Hamlets court ruling
- "Unlawful to remove three LTNs"
- Campaigners' legal win protects quiet streets

**Blueprint (NYC Curiosity):**
- "Safer, Quieter Streets"
- Less traffic on boundary roads too
- Fewer casualties
- Proven urban planning principles

## Heat Pumps & Building Electrification 2025

**Market Status (Canary Media 2025):**
- Heat pump sales beat gas furnaces
- "12% more air-source heat pump units shipped than gas furnaces"
- Next most-popular heating appliance

**California 2025 Energy Code:**
- "Expands use of heat pumps in newly constructed residential buildings"
- "Encourages electric-readiness"
- "Strengthens ventilation standards"
- Effective January 1, 2026

**Technology (NREL):**
- Residential and commercial applications
- "Replace fossil fuel heating"
- "Help buildings reach decarbonization goals"

**IEA Energy Efficiency 2025:**
- "Accelerate deployment of electric heating systems"
- "Regulate fossil fuel-based heating technologies"
- "Harmonize labels"

**2025 Wrapped (Building Decarb Dec 2025):**
- "Gas infrastructure is an expensive problem"
- "Electrification is the solution"
- "Grid is cleaner than ever"
- Heat pumps key technology

**NYISO Forecast:**
- Building electrification projections
- Air source heat pump principles
- Moving thermal energy between indoor/outdoor

## Third Places & Cultural Spaces 2025

**Definition (Oldenburg):**
- Spaces beyond home (first) and work (second)
- "Invisible scaffolding of our mental lives"
- "Hold you up without asking"

**Crisis:**
- "Vanishing spaces where we used to just exist"
- Disappearing due to: rising rents, hostile urban design, digital displacement
- Correlates with: loneliness, civic decay, mental health crises

**But:**
- "Communities worldwide proving these spaces can be rebuilt"
- "Intentional design" required

**Cultural Institutions as Third Spaces:**
- "Beyond gallery walls"
- Attract new audiences
- Expand revenue streams
- Build partnerships
- Strengthen community ties

**Examples:**
- Cafes
- Libraries
- Parks
- Bars
- Community centers
- Food halls

**Smithsonian (Aug 2025):**
- "Third places are being reimagined"
- "Welcoming travelers"
- Parks, food halls, libraries stepping up with social offerings

## Synthesis: Streets + Energy + Community for Living Cities

| System | Current | Living City |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Streets | Through-traffic | LTN design |
| Heating | Gas/oil | Heat pump |
| Community | Vanishing | Third places protected |

**Living City Design:**

1. **Low Traffic Neighborhoods:**
   - All residential areas as LTNs
   - Through-traffic eliminated
   - Bollards, planters, modal filters
   - Quiet, safe, walkable streets

2. **Heat Pump Standard:**
   - No new fossil fuel heating
   - All buildings heat pump ready
   - Community-scale ground source where feasible
   - Grid integration for flexibility

3. **Third Place Network:**
   - Protected from market forces
   - Every neighborhood: cafe, library, community hall
   - Cultural institutions as anchors
   - "Invisible scaffolding" maintained

**Metric:**
- % of streets as LTN
- % of buildings with heat pumps
- Third places per 1,000 residents
