# Mutual Aid, Tactical Urbanism, Smart City Critique — Direct Research Feb 20

## Mutual Aid Networks 2025

**Post-COVID Evolution:**
- "Community mutual aid is a form of community engagement"
- Multiple stakeholders providing material and emotional support

**Research Framework (Frontiers June 2025):**
- Six main categories identified:
  1. Disaster risk
  2. Community networks
  3. Participation pathways
  4. Psychological motivations
  5. Community resilience
  6. Social relationships

**Case Studies:**

**DC Ward 6 Mutual Aid:**
- Mobilized during COVID-19
- Food, supplies, direct cash assistance
- Focus: "Redistribute wealth and resources to Black communities facing displacement"

**East Boston (June 2025 report):**
- Three underlying values:
  1. Reciprocity
  2. Shared humanity and interdependence
  3. Community-driven care and redistribution

**Community Resiliency Hubs (Daily Yonder Sept 2025):**
- "Local self-sufficiency and supportive mutual aid"
- Promise of community resilience for future disasters

**Key Insight:** Vulnerability creates sites for "creating new" systems, not just responding to old ones.

## Tactical Urbanism 2025

**Definition:**
- "Lighter, quicker, cheaper" placemaking
- Low-cost, temporary interventions
- Transform streets into social spaces

**Methods:**
- Parklets
- Painted crosswalks
- Pop-up plazas
- Open-street events
- Better blocks

**TUN25 Competition (Dec 2025):**
- "Tactical Urbanism NOW!"
- Rethinking potential of urban environments
- Small-scale interventions

**Street Plans 2025 Review:**
- Team of planners, designers, engineers
- Tactical urbanism as common thread
- Spanning urban design, transportation, placemaking

**SPARK Program:**
- "Greater role for temporary placemaking"
- Bring meaningful design to placemaking
- Communities + designers driving long-term change
- Pop-up as prototype

**Key Insight:** Test before permanent investment; community involvement essential.

## Smart City Privacy Critique 2025

**Growing Concern:**
- "Extensive implementation has increased privacy and data protection concerns"
- Growing dependence on surveillance technology
- Challenges protecting individual privacy

**Technologies Under Scrutiny:**
- Artificial intelligence
- Facial recognition
- IoT-connected sensors
- Predictive analytics
- LiDAR sensors

**Academic Analysis:**

**ScienceDirect (2025 - 10 citations):**
- "Advancing innovation while simultaneously safeguarding personal data"
- Finding balance is key challenge

**SSRN (Jan 2025):**
- "Threat to Privacy or Tool for Public Safety?"
- Questioning whether surveillance is "only means for protecting people"
- Or "another invasive method to violate rights"

**IntechOpen:**
- "Balancing Innovation" with privacy
- Examining role of AI in surveillance
- Modern surveillance infrastructure challenges

**Oregon Capital Chronicle (Jan 2025):**
- "Smart cities tools grow, so do privacy and ethical concerns"
- Increased monitoring, data collection, analysis
- Nationwide trend

## Synthesis: Human-Scale vs Surveillance Approaches

| Approach | Mutual Aid | Tactical Urbanism | Smart City |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| Scale | Community | Neighborhood | City-wide |
| Control | Residents | Community + designers | Tech companies |
| Data | Relationship-based | Observation | Surveillance |
| Cost | Low | Low-medium | High |
| Privacy | High | High | Low |

**Living City Design:**

1. **Mutual Aid Infrastructure:**
   - Build resilience through relationships, not surveillance
   - Resiliency hubs in every neighborhood
   - Redistribute resources, not monitor them

2. **Tactical Urbanism:**
   - Test interventions before permanent investment
   - Community-driven design process
   - "Lighter, quicker, cheaper" first

3. **Smart City Caution:**
   - Reject surveillance-based "smart" solutions
   - Privacy-preserving technology only
   - Community control of data
   - No facial recognition, predictive policing

**Design Principle:** Living Cities should be "wise" not "smart" — intelligence through relationships, not surveillance.

**Metric:**
- Mutual aid network coverage
- % of public space decisions using tactical testing
- Data sovereignty: % of data under community control
