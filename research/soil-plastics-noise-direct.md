# Soil Health, Plastics Pollution, Noise Pollution — Direct Research Feb 20

## Urban Soil Health 2025

**The Challenge (Frontiers 2025):**
- Soil pollution exacerbated by rapid urbanization
- Intensive agriculture impacts
- Complex mix of contaminants: heavy metals, pesticides, PFAS, microplastics
- "Severe risks to environmental health and agricultural productivity"

**Academic Review (ScienceDirect 2025):**
- Most represented topics: soil pollution/remediation (37%), soil health assessment (30%)
- Ecosystem services (14%)
- Water management and green infrastructure

**LA Wildfires Impact (TreePeople June 2025):**
- "Exposed a long-standing problem"
- "Serious lack of soil support resources"
- Missing: urban soil education, testing, remediation options
- Public concern finally rising

**EU Commitment:**
- "Enhancing health of soil"
- For benefit of people, food, nature
- Policy framework developing

**Remediation Approaches (Tandfonline 2025):**
- "Healing people, soils and science"
- Urban soil remediation for food production
- Agroecological values integration
- Transdisciplinary research

**Key Framing:** Healthy soil = healthy food, healthy people, healthy ecosystems.

## Plastics & Microplastics Pollution 2025

**Scale (OPG Bio Solutions):**
- 11-12.7 million metric tons entering oceans yearly
- Rising microplastic concentrations
- Great Pacific Garbage Patch growing
- Wildlife impacts documented
- Human health risks confirmed

**Projections (ScienceDirect - 250 citations):**
- 2020: 464 Mt global plastic use
- 2050: 884 Mt projected
- 4,725 Mt accumulated plastics by 2050

**Breaking the Plastic Wave 2025 (Pew + Systemiq):**
- Update to groundbreaking 2020 report
- "Existing solutions could reduce microplastic pollution by 41%"
- Innovative strategies needed for remainder

**EU Regulation (Nov 2025):**
- Regulation on preventing plastic pellet losses
- EU 2025/2365
- Applies to all economic operators
- Targeting microplastic source

**WWF Global Treaty:**
- "End Plastic Pollution"
- Phasing out unnecessary plastic products
- Single-use items targeted
- Excessive packaging elimination
- Binding commitments sought

**Key Framing:** Plastic is poisoning oceans, wildlife, and human bodies — eliminate it.

## Noise Pollution & Health 2025

**Health Impacts (UC Davis):**
- "Environmental noise pollution quietly affects health"
- Road traffic, railway, airports, industrial sites
- Involuntary exposure

**Documented Effects (Decibel International July 2025):**
- Increased risk of heart disease
- Disturbed sleep
- Reduced concentration
- Anxiety and mental health impacts

**EU Assessment:**
- "Noise is the other face of urban pollution"
- "Often overlooked"
- "Cities struggle to address effectively"

**Chronic Conditions (ScienceDirect):**
- Noise linked to obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases
- Green spaces may mitigate perception and effects
- Research area growing

**Leading Cities (Ecreee Feb 2026):**
- Copenhagen and Singapore lead with noise-reduction policies
- Sound barriers
- Low-noise pavements
- Expanded quiet zones

**Solutions:**
- Urban planning prioritizing green buffers
- Quiet zones
- Traffic reduction (LTNs)
- Low-noise surfaces

**Key Framing:** Noise makes people sick — quieter cities are healthier cities.

## Synthesis: Real Pollution → Real Health for Living Cities

| Pollution | Health Impact | Living City Solution |
|-----------|--------------|---------------------|
| Contaminated Soil | Food safety, exposure | Remediation, testing, clean growing |
| Plastics | Endocrine disruption, ingestion | Elimination at source |
| Noise | Heart disease, sleep, anxiety | Quiet zones, traffic reduction |

**Living City Design:**

1. **Soil Regeneration:**
   - All urban soil tested
   - Contaminated sites remediated
   - Ongoing soil health monitoring
   - No toxic inputs allowed

2. **Plastic Elimination:**
   - No single-use plastics
   - All packaging compostable or reusable
   - Material passports for all products
   - Zero plastic to waste stream

3. **Quiet by Design:**
   - No combustion vehicles = major noise reduction
   - Green buffers throughout
   - Quiet zone designation
   - Low-noise materials standard

**Metric:**
- Soil contaminant levels (heavy metals, PFAS)
- Plastic waste generated per capita
- Noise levels (dB) at residential areas
