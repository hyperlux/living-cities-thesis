## Synthesis: Digital + Civic + Food Infrastructure for Living Cities

| Organ | DPI Role | Civic Tech Role | Local Food Role |
|-------|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Governance | Identity, payments | Decision platforms | Food policy input |
| Exchange | Digital currency | Participatory budgeting | Local markets |
| Food | Supply chain tracking | Food council voting | Production |
| Care | G2P payments | Health feedback | Nutrition access |
| Connection | Communication | Community input | Farmers markets |

**Living City Application:**

1. **Digital Public Infrastructure:**
   - Community identity system
   - Internal payment rails (social currency)
   - G2P payments for UBI/services

2. **Civic Tech:**
   - Participatory budgeting platform
   - Policy co-creation tools
   - Government monitoring

3. **Local Food:**
   - Community-supported agriculture
   - Short supply chains
   - Fair prices to producers

**Design Principle:** Living Cities should have:
- DPI layer for identity + payments + services
- Civic tech platform for all governance decisions
- Local food system with <100km average distance

**Metric:**
- % of payments through community DPI
- % of decisions through civic tech platform
- % of food from local sources
