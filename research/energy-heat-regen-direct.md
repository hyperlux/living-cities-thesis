# Energy Democracy, Heat Islands, Regenerative Agriculture — Direct Research Feb 20

## Energy Democracy 2025

**Definition:**
- Who owns, controls, and benefits from energy systems
- "Take on political and economic change needed to tackle energy transition holistically"
- Community organizers + labor + renewable advocates

**Working Models:**
- People Power Solar Cooperative
- Co-op Power: "multirace, multiclass community energy coop"
- "Long-term ownership and stewardship of community energy"

**ILSR Report (2025):**
- "Advantage Local: Why Local Energy Ownership Matters"
- Community Power Scorecard tracking state-level progress
- Wins and losses documented

**Global Examples:**
- Solar-powered villages in Morocco
- Grassroots cooperatives in Costa Rica
- Community initiatives in Brazil

**Rural Revival Connection (Frontiers 2026):**
- "Trajectory of rural energy transitions profoundly shaped by who owns, controls, and benefits"
- Community-driven solar, wind, biomass across US
- Energy democracy as "engine of rural revival"

**Key Insight:** 
- "Locally owned clean energy projects helping communities grow jobs, build wealth, make their own decisions"
- Continues "even as federal government cuts support"

## Urban Heat Island Mitigation 2025

**The Problem:**
- UHI: significant environmental and public health challenge
- Cities significantly hotter than surrounding areas
- Exacerbated by climate change

**Green Infrastructure Solutions (MDPI 2025 - 58 citations):**
- Green roofs
- Green facades
- Shrubs
- Trees
- "Adding natural surfaces like vegetation back into communities"

**Vienna Urban Heat Island Strategy:**
- Temperature differences between districts
- Depends on level of green/blue infrastructure
- Degree of sealing (impermeable surfaces)
- Strategy document published

**EPA Guidance (April 2025):**
- Green infrastructure mitigates heat island effect
- Provides cooling
- Multiple co-benefits

**Complex Implementation (ScienceDirect):**
- Challenges in high-density environments
- Cold climate cities have different needs
- Requires "comprehensive multi-scale" approach

## Regenerative Agriculture & Carbon Drawdown 2025

**The Promise:**
- Not just reduce emissions
- Actually DRAW DOWN carbon from atmosphere
- Store in soil

**Project Drawdown (Sept 2025):**
- "Improve Annual Cropping" as key solution
- Increases soil carbon sequestration
- Reduces nitrous oxide emissions
- Used in conservation agriculture

**Economics:**
- Implementation cost: $355.05 per hectare
- Net profit achievable
- "From soil to shelf" supply chain integration

**Brazil Example (Inplanet):**
- Enhanced weathering
- Partners directly with local farmers
- Restore soil health
- Transition toward sustainable agriculture

**Key Insight (ScienceDirect 2025):**
- "Response to pre-eminent paradox: how to feed world without eroding ecological capacity"
- Regenerative = solution to food security AND climate

## Synthesis: Energy + Cooling + Food in Living Cities

| Organ | Energy Democracy | Heat Mitigation | Regenerative |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Energy | Community solar/wind | Green roofs reduce cooling need | Biogas from agriculture |
| Land | Local ownership | Permeable surfaces | Soil building |
| Food | Processing energy | Food forest cooling | Production method |
| Care | Reduce energy poverty | Heat-related health | Nutrition quality |
| Governance | Democratic control | Planning decisions | Land stewardship |

**Design Principle:** Living Cities should:
1. Own their energy infrastructure (cooperative model)
2. Achieve net-zero heat island effect (equal green infrastructure to built)
3. Practice regenerative food production (drawdown, not emissions)

**Metric:**
- % of energy community-owned
- Temperature differential vs surrounding area
- Soil carbon increase per year
