# Fab Labs & Food Forests — Direct Research Feb 20

## Fab Lab Movement 2025

**Scale:**
- Over 1,000 fab labs globally (Fab25 conference data)
- FAB25 Czechia theme: "Bridge The Gap"
- Neil Gershenfeld (MIT): "intellectual father of the maker movement"

**What Fab Labs Provide:**
- Widespread access to prototype tools
- Personal fabrication capabilities
- Distributed research and education
- Digital fabrication principles and practices

**Fab City Model:**
- Hamburg Playbook published 2025
- Goes beyond individual labs to city-scale production
- "New industrial revolution" framing

**Academic Analysis (ScienceDirect):**
- Makerspaces and fab labs driving innovation and entrepreneurship
- "Transformative phenomenon"
- Global expansion documented

**Key Insight (MIT News 2025):**
- "Bringing manufacturing back to America, one fab lab at a time"
- "Very bottom-up distribution of MIT culture"
- Won't replace mass manufacturing BUT
- Local production makes "more interesting things that differ for individuals"
- Customization > standardization

**Fabricademy:**
- Intersection of fabrication, biotechnology, innovative materials
- 3D modeling and local distributed manufacturing
- Active at Maker Faire Brussels 2025

## Urban Food Forests 2025

**Denver Case Study (Sept 2025):**
- Food forests provide FREE fruit
- Greening the environment simultaneously
- Denver Urban Gardens leading
- Food Forest in Arvada

**European Projects (Dec 2025):**
- 7 pioneering urban farm projects across Europe
- Warsaw co-op
- London vertical farm
- "Innovative spaces changing cities"

**Thessaloniki Transformation:**
- Transformed neglected urban area in Neapoli
- Thriving food forest
- Tackles biodiversity loss
- Green space shortage solution
- Interreg Europe "Green Sustainable Paths" project

**Permaculture Integration:**
- "Sustainable city spaces blending edible landscaping with community gardens"
- "Green oases transforming urban environments"
- Promoting food security

**Wildlife Corridor Function:**
- Food forests as "habitat mosaics"
- Green corridor for wildlife through towns/cities
- Urban rewilding meets food production

## Synthesis: Making + Growing in Living Cities

**Connection:**

1. **Fab Labs** = distributed production of goods
   - Tools, furniture, repairs, prototypes
   - Digital fabrication + traditional craft
   - Local customization

2. **Food Forests** = distributed production of food
   - Free fruit, perennial vegetables
   - Low maintenance once established
   - Wildlife habitat + human food

**Living City Application:**

| Organ | Fab Lab Role | Food Forest Role |
|-------|--------------|------------------|
| Making | Production hub | — |
| Food | Tool repair, processing equipment | Primary food production |
| Care | Assistive device fabrication | Therapeutic gardens |
| Learning | Skills education | Nature education |
| Land | Outdoor workspace | Productive landscape |

**Design Principle:** Every Living City neighborhood should have:
- One fab lab within 15-minute walk
- Food forest visible from every residence
- Path connecting making and growing spaces

**Integration Pattern:**
- Food forest mulch → biochar → soil amendment
- Fab lab makes: signs, trellises, processing tools, carts
- Food forest yields → fab lab kitchen for processing
- Closed loop between making and growing

**Metric:**
- Fab lab access: % of residents within 15-minute walk
- Food forest coverage: m² per resident
