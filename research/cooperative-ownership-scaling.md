# Cooperative Ownership Models: Scaling in 2025-2026

## Executive Summary

2025 marks the **UN International Year of Cooperatives** under the theme "Cooperatives Build a Better World." This timing creates unprecedented visibility for cooperative models precisely when questions of scale, governance, and digital transformation are reaching critical inflection points. This research examines how cooperative ownership models are scaling across platform cooperatives, housing, worker federations, and data cooperatives—and what governance structures prove effective at scale.

**Key findings:**
- At least 12% of humanity (over 1 billion people) are members of the world's ~3 million cooperatives
- The top 300 cooperatives generate $2.79 trillion USD in annual turnover
- Platform cooperatives remain small but demonstrate sustainable alternative models
- Data cooperatives are emerging as a critical new frontier for digital sovereignty
- Federation structures (Mondragon, Emilia-Romagna model) remain the most proven path to scale while preserving democratic governance

## 1. Platform Cooperatives: State of Play 2025-2026

### Definition & Principles

Platform cooperatives are businesses that sell goods or services primarily through websites, mobile apps, or protocols, distinguished by:

- **Democratic decision-making** and shared platform ownership by workers and users
- **Broad-based ownership** where workers control technological features, production processes, algorithms, data, and job structures
- **Co-design** ensuring software grows from stakeholder needs and aspirations
- **Aspiration toward open source** development and open data
- **Stakeholder primacy** over shareholder extraction

### Case Studies

#### Up&Go (New York, USA)
**Status: Active and growing**

Up&Go represents one of the most successful platform cooperative models in the gig economy:

- Worker-owned home cleaning platform connecting professional cleaners directly with clients
- **95% of revenue goes to workers** (only 5¢ of every dollar to platform operations)
- Cleaners are peer-selected through reference checks, interviews, and trial cleanings
- Quality-assured service with sustainable cleaning methods
- Featured in BBC, New York Times, Wired, and Fast Company

**Governance insight:** Up&Go succeeds by keeping scope focused (home cleaning), geography limited (New York metropolitan), and governance simple (worker-owners make key decisions collectively). Scale is achieved through replication—inspiring similar cooperatives elsewhere—rather than centralized expansion.

#### Stocksy United (Victoria, BC, Canada)
**Status: Active**

Stocksy is a stock photography cooperative founded in 2013:

- Artist-owned platform competing with Getty Images and Shutterstock
- Photographers receive 50-75% royalties (vs. industry standard 15-45%)
- Over 1,000 contributing artists as member-owners
- Democratically governed with member voting on key decisions

**Scaling challenge:** Stocksy demonstrates the tension between cooperative principles and growth imperatives—maintaining quality curation while expanding membership, and preserving intimate governance as numbers grow.

#### Resonate
**Status: Dissolved (2024)**

Resonate was a streaming music cooperative using a "stream2own" model:

- Members would gradually purchase music through streaming
- Artists retained ownership and received higher payouts
- Used blockchain for transparent royalty distribution

**Failure analysis:** Resonate's dissolution offers critical lessons:
- Undercapitalization relative to competitors (Spotify raised billions)
- Technical complexity of blockchain integration without clear user benefit
- Difficulty achieving network effects needed for music discovery
- Governance overhead in an industry requiring rapid iteration

The community forums remain active as members process lessons learned.

### Emerging Platform Cooperative Sectors

**Ride-hailing & delivery:**
- Eva Coop (Montreal) - driver-owned ride platform on EOSIO blockchain
- Local taxi cooperatives adopting app technology

**Creative & knowledge work:**
- Distributed freelancer collectives using cooperative structures
- Tech worker cooperatives (Boston Tech Collective, Vermont Computing Cooperative)

## 2. Housing Cooperatives: 2025-2026 Trends

### Scale of the Sector

Housing cooperatives represent one of the most mature cooperative sectors globally:

- National Association of Housing Cooperatives (NAHC) serves as the US federation
- Includes housing cooperatives, mutual housing associations, and resident-owned communities
- Manufactured housing cooperatives converting from investor ownership

### Growth Drivers 2025-2026

1. **Housing affordability crisis:** As median home prices exceed median incomes by historic ratios, cooperative housing offers entry point for those priced out of ownership

2. **Institutional investment backlash:** Communities organizing against private equity landlords find cooperative conversion an exit strategy

3. **Aging infrastructure:** Mobile home park residents purchasing communities cooperatively to prevent displacement

4. **Climate adaptation:** Shared ownership structures enable collective retrofitting investments

### Governance at Scale: The Limited Equity Model

Limited equity cooperatives (LECs) balance individual wealth-building with permanent affordability:

- Members purchase shares at affordable prices
- Resale prices capped (often tied to inflation or area median income)
- Governance through elected boards and membership meetings
- Successful LECs demonstrate decades of stable, democratic operation

**Key governance structures:**
- Clear bylaws defining member rights and responsibilities
- Elected boards with term limits preventing entrenchment
- Professional management for operations, member governance for policy
- Reserve funds for long-term maintenance
- Waiting lists and member screening for community fit

### Case Examples

**Cooperative Fund of the Northeast** finances housing cooperatives including:
- Raise-Op Housing Cooperative (Lewiston, ME)
- Turnpike Park Cooperative (Westborough, MA)
- Focus on manufactured housing preservation and urban housing conversion

## 3. Worker Cooperative Federations: Models for Scale

### The Mondragon Model

**MONDRAGON Corporation** remains the global exemplar of cooperative scaling:

**Current scale (2024-2025):**
- 81 separate, self-governing cooperatives
- ~70,000 worker-members
- 12 R&D centers
- #1 in Basque Country business ranking, #10 in Spain
- 104 production plants in 37 countries
- Sales in 150+ countries

**Four divisions:**
- Finance (Laboral Kutxa banking)
- Industry (machine tools, automotive components, appliances)
- Retail (Eroski supermarket chain)
- Knowledge (Mondragon University, research centers)

**Governance architecture for scale:**

1. **Cooperative sovereignty:** Each cooperative maintains self-governance
2. **Federation structure:** Cooperatives group into sectoral clusters
3. **One person, one vote:** Democratic principles at every level
4. **Inter-cooperation:** Mandatory solidarity between cooperatives
5. **Wage solidarity:** Pay ratios capped (historically 1:6, now 1:8)
6. **Capital subordination:** Returns to labor prioritized over returns to capital
7. **Social transformation commitment:** Reinvestment in community
8. **Education principle:** Major investment in cooperative education

**Scaling mechanisms:**
- New cooperatives incubated from within the system
- Support structures (banking, education, R&D) serve all members
- Cross-subsidization during downturns
- Worker redeployment rather than layoffs

**Challenges and adaptations:**
- 2013 Fagor Electrodomésticos bankruptcy tested solidarity (workers relocated to other cooperatives)
- Internationalization creates tension with local employment focus
- Maintaining democratic culture as scale increases

### US Federation of Worker Cooperatives (USFWC)

**Mission:** "Build a thriving ecosystem for worker-owned and controlled businesses and their cooperative leaders to power movements for racial justice and economic democracy"

**Structure:**
- Grassroots member-led movement
- Membership from worker cooperatives, democratic workplaces, cooperative developers, and allied organizations
- Advocacy, education, and network-building

### CICOPA (International)

The International Organisation of Industrial and Service Cooperatives:
- 52 members from 36 countries
- Affiliates 65,000 enterprises
- Employs 4 million people worldwide
- Operates through regional bodies: CECOP (Europe), CICOPA Américas, CICOPA Asia-Pacific

### Democracy at Work Institute (DAWI)

Research and development arm for US worker cooperatives:
- "Data Together" program: Non-extractive research practices centering worker benefits
- Publishes resources on power, information, people, and money in cooperatives
- Develops tools for cooperative developers

## 4. Data Cooperatives: The New Frontier

### The Data Cooperative Model

Data cooperatives represent a significant evolution in cooperative thinking for the digital age:

**Definition (Project Liberty Institute):** "A form of cooperative organization based on the ownership and governance of data"

**Key characteristics:**
- Members consent to have a cooperative hold copies of their data
- The cooperative is democratically governed by its members
- The entity safeguards data and represents members in negotiations
- Members have voice, choice, and stake in data decisions

**Distinction from related models:**
- **Data trusts:** More top-down; trustees decide for contributors
- **Data commons:** Data pooled as common resource but often lacking individual rights
- **Data cooperatives:** Prioritize member ownership, autonomy, and shared prosperity

### MIDATA: The Leading Health Data Cooperative

**Founded:** Switzerland, 2015

**Model:**
- Citizens securely store, manage, and control access to personal health data
- Platform enables participation in app-based research and clinical studies
- Members govern the cooperative at general assembly
- Regional/national cooperatives share platform infrastructure

**Core principles:**
1. **Citizen-owned:** Members govern at general assembly
2. **Non-profit:** No financial incentives; net profits reinvested
3. **Transparent:** Governance principles public; members participate in decisions
4. **Secure:** All datasets encrypted; individual access only; all access logged
5. **Regional:** Enables national cooperatives with common rules
6. **Open source:** Platform based on OSS from ETH Zurich and Bern University (GNU GPL v3.0)

**Expansion potential 2025-2026:**
- Model designed for international replication
- Each national cooperative maintains local governance
- Shared technical infrastructure reduces costs
- Federated model enables global research while protecting local sovereignty

### Other Data Cooperative Models

**Salus Coop (Barcelona, 2017):**
- Non-profit health data cooperative
- Citizen-driven governance of health data
- Facilitates data sharing for public research innovation

**Swash:**
- Browser extension and digital wallet
- Largest "data union" globally
- Users paid for browsing data

**Driver's Seat Cooperative:**
- Worker-owned ride-hailing data platform
- Aimed at distributed data governance for gig workers
- Financial sustainability challenges led to transition to Princeton research initiative

**Project Liberty Institute analysis:**
Data cooperatives are developing alongside data trusts and data associations. Current experimentation reflects:
- Absence of established best practices
- Lack of comprehensive regulatory frameworks
- Space for innovation but increased risk of setbacks
- Need for adaptive learning and iterative design

## 5. Governance Structures That Work at Scale

### Key Principles from Successful Scaled Cooperatives

#### 1. Federated Sovereignty
The most successful large cooperative systems maintain unit-level autonomy while enabling collective action:
- **Mondragon:** 81 cooperatives, each self-governing
- **Credit unions:** Federated through CUNA/leagues while locally controlled
- **Housing cooperatives:** Individual co-ops with trade association support

#### 2. Subsidiarity
Decisions made at the lowest appropriate level:
- Operational decisions by management
- Policy decisions by elected boards
- Constitutional decisions by full membership
- Inter-cooperative decisions by federation bodies

#### 3. Professional Management + Democratic Oversight
Scaling requires expertise while preserving member control:
- Hired professional managers for operations
- Elected boards for strategic direction and accountability
- Member assemblies for fundamental decisions
- Clear separation between governance and management

#### 4. Term Limits and Rotation
Preventing entrenchment while building institutional capacity:
- Board term limits (typically 2-3 terms maximum)
- Leadership development programs
- Mentorship between outgoing and incoming leaders

#### 5. Education Investment
Mondragon Principle #10: "Education - Promoting people and cooperative culture"
- Cooperative education for all members
- Leadership development pathways
- Ongoing training in democratic participation

#### 6. Inter-cooperation Mechanisms
Formal structures for mutual support:
- Shared services (banking, insurance, training)
- Cross-subsidization during difficulties
- Worker redeployment rather than layoffs
- Collective purchasing and marketing

#### 7. Capital Structures That Subordinate Capital to Labor
- Non-withdrawable capital reserves
- Limited returns on capital
- Profit allocation based on labor contribution
- Patient capital from cooperative sources

### The Scale Paradox

Cooperatives face a fundamental tension:

**Small scale:** Intimate governance, high participation, limited resources and impact
**Large scale:** Greater resources and impact, governance complexity, participation challenges

**Successful solutions:**

1. **Federation:** Small units connected through larger structures
2. **Replication:** Spreading the model rather than growing the organization
3. **Hybrid structures:** Cooperative core with subsidiaries for specific functions
4. **Digital democracy:** Technology enabling participation at scale

### Technology and Governance

Emerging tools for cooperative governance at scale:
- Online voting and deliberation platforms
- Transparent financial dashboards
- Member communication tools
- Decision-support systems

**Caution:** Technology can enable but not substitute for democratic culture. Resonate's blockchain approach added complexity without solving fundamental governance challenges.

## 6. Implications for 2025-2026

### Opportunities

1. **UN International Year visibility:** Unprecedented global attention on cooperatives
2. **Tech worker disillusionment:** Growing interest in democratic alternatives post-layoffs
3. **AI governance questions:** Data cooperatives positioned as alternative to big tech control
4. **Housing crisis:** Cooperative models as solution to financialization
5. **Supply chain reshoring:** Worker cooperatives for domestic manufacturing

### Challenges

1. **Capital access:** Cooperatives still disadvantaged in traditional finance
2. **Legal frameworks:** Many jurisdictions lack enabling cooperative legislation
3. **Network effects:** Platform cooperatives struggle against established monopolies
4. **Education:** Low public understanding of cooperative model
5. **Succession:** Aging cooperative leadership in traditional sectors

### Key Questions for Scaling

1. **When to federate vs. grow?** Under what conditions should cooperatives expand internally vs. replicate independently?

2. **How to maintain culture?** What practices preserve democratic participation as membership grows?

3. **Digital transformation:** How can traditional cooperatives adopt technology while preserving member relationships?

4. **Cross-sector cooperation:** How can platform, worker, housing, and data cooperatives support each other?

5. **Policy advocacy:** What legal and financial frameworks would enable cooperative scaling?

## 7. Research Gaps and Future Directions

### Areas Requiring Further Study

1. **Comparative governance:** Systematic comparison of governance structures across successful scaled cooperatives

2. **Failure analysis:** Deep studies of cooperative dissolutions and their causes

3. **Technology impact:** Effects of digital tools on member participation and governance quality

4. **Generational transition:** How cooperatives transfer culture and ownership across generations

5. **Capital structures:** Innovative financing mechanisms for cooperative growth

6. **Intersectoral cooperation:** How different cooperative types can create mutual support systems
