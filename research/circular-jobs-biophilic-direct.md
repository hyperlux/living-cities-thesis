# Circular Economy Jobs & Biophilic Design — Direct Research Feb 20

## Circular Economy Employment 2025

**First Global Baseline (December 2025):**
- ILO + World Bank + Circle Economy + PAGE collaboration
- "Employment in the circular economy: Leveraging circularity to create decent work"
- First comprehensive estimate of scale, structure, characteristics

**Key Finding:**
- **121-142 million people worldwide employed in circular economy**
- Already massive employment sector
- Need for targeted policies to "green" these jobs

**Green Transition Jobs (WEF Nov 2025):**
- Impact: 14.4 million jobs globally by 2030
- Net gain: +9.6 million new roles
- Risk: "Creating new economic divides" if not managed

**European Context (EEA):**
- Green employment = "key enabler for just transition"
- Definition: "Decent jobs that contribute to preserving or restoring environment"
- Historic trends assessed; future outlook documented

**Implication for Living Cities:**
- Circular economy IS an employment strategy
- 121-142M jobs already exist
- Building Living Cities creates local circular economy jobs
- Must design for "just transition" — avoid new divides

## Biophilic Design 2025

**Definition:**
- Reintroducing living elements into built spaces
- Street trees, natural light, urban meadows, vegetated interiors
- Beyond aesthetics → measurable health effects

**2025 Research Status:**
- "Results published in 2025 bring solid evidence"
- No longer just aesthetic approach
- Measured effects on mental health documented

**Office Applications:**
- Views of trees → reduced stress, improved mood
- Fresh air access
- Natural materials
- Green walls
- Innovative lighting solutions (mimicking daylight)

**City-Scale:**
- "Biophilic infrastructure weaves nature into urban environment"
- Makes cities "more livable in the long run"
- Works WITH nature, not against

**Wellbeing Impacts:**
- Reduced stress levels
- Improved mood
- Positive impact on mental and physical health
- "Wellness revolution happening all around us"

## Synthesis: Work + Nature in Living Cities

**Connection:**

1. **Circular economy employment** provides jobs
   - Repair, remanufacture, recycling
   - Local food production
   - Maintenance and care work
   
2. **Biophilic design** provides health
   - Natural materials in work spaces
   - Green views from every building
   - Outdoor work options

**Living City Application:**

| Organ | Circular Jobs | Biophilic Integration |
|-------|---------------|----------------------|
| Making | Repair cafés, makerspaces | Natural light workshops |
| Food | Urban farms, processing | Edible landscapes visible from all buildings |
| Care | Health services | Nature-integrated healing spaces |
| Housing | Maintenance, renovation | Green walls, roof gardens |
| Exchange | Time banking, social currency | Outdoor markets |

**Design Principle:** Every workspace in a Living City should have:
- Direct natural light
- Views of greenery
- Connection to circular economy activity
- Path to outdoor work areas

**Metric:** 
- % of jobs in circular economy
- Biophilic elements per building (trees visible, natural materials, daylight access)
