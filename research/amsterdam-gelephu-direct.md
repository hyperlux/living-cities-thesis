## Key Patterns

**Amsterdam:**
- Pioneered city-scale doughnut methodology
- Created replicable framework (50+ cities)
- Tension between circular economy goals and growth imperatives
- Assessment tools exist but implementation varies

**Gelephu:**
- Starts from spiritual/philosophical foundation
- Nation-building narrative (sovereignty, security, future)
- $100B scale with green tech + crypto hybrid model
- Recognition through Holcim Award validates design approach

**Common Thread:** Both attempt to embed values (ecological/spiritual) into economic structure from the start, rather than retrofitting sustainability onto existing city models.

**Contrast with Vienna:** Vienna succeeded through 100 years of incremental commitment. Amsterdam and Gelephu attempt to design new frameworks comprehensively upfront. Jury still out on whether comprehensive design can match incremental evolution.
