## Synthesis: Health + Connection in Living Cities

**Connection:**

1. **Social Prescribing** = formal health intervention using community resources
   - Nature-based activities
   - Community groups
   - Arts and culture

2. **Third Places** = informal infrastructure of connection
   - Where social prescribing activities happen
   - Where spontaneous connection occurs
   - Where loneliness is prevented before it starts

**Living City Application:**

| Organ | Social Prescribing | Third Places |
|-------|-------------------|--------------|
| Care | Nature prescriptions, community activities | Healing gardens, therapy spaces |
| Connection | Group activities, peer support | Cafes, plazas, community halls |
| Food | Community meals, cooking classes | Shared kitchens, market squares |
| Culture | Arts therapy, music groups | Studios, performance spaces |
| Learning | Skill-sharing, mentorship | Libraries, workshop spaces |

**Design Principle:** Every Living City neighborhood should:
- Have third places within 5-minute walk of every home
- Integrate social prescribing pathways into care system
- Design for "accidental" encounters (not just programmed activities)

**Metric:**
- Third places per 1,000 residents
- % of care referrals that include social prescribing
- Self-reported loneliness rate
