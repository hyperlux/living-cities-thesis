# Citizen Science & Indigenous Urban Planning — Direct Research Feb 20

## Citizen Science for Environmental Monitoring 2025

**Nature (2025):**
- "Citizen science now essential for official statistics"
- Fund official surveys AND citizen science
- "More adaptive and flexible ways of collecting data"

**Frontiers Research Topic:**
- "Environmental Citizen Science: Insights 2025"
- Environmental conservation
- Community participation
- Citizen data collection

**Clean Air Application (CCAC Coalition):**
- "Powerful Ally for Clean Air"
- Netherlands: RIVM integrating Sensor.Community data
- Community air quality monitoring

**NILU (March 2025):**
- "Citizen science projects can spread knowledge"
- "Generate increased awareness and commitment"
- Environmental challenges addressed

**ERICA Project (UB March 2025):**
- European project combining science + citizen participation
- "Improve environmental monitoring"
- "Citizen science becomes key tool"

**Extinction Risk Monitoring (BES Journals 2025):**
- "Monitoring population extinction risk with community science data"
- Addresses limitations in estimating risk
- Can be "rapidly" implemented

**Key Framing:** Citizens can monitor their own environment — data power to communities.

## Indigenous Urban Planning 2025

**Nature (2025):**
- "Reimagining, reclaiming, and reconnecting Indigenous voices"
- Indigenous People often included only for cultural heritage/street art
- NOT included in overall governance of cities
- This needs to change

**Policy Options (2024):**
- "Co-creating cities through Indigenous knowledge"
- "Nature-based solutions"
- Indigenous communities have "most proactive planning for climate-change adaptation"
- "Great power in their knowledge"
- Often disregarded despite importance

**AARP Report:**
- "Intergenerational Ingenuity: Indigenous Urban Planning & Design"
- UN Special Rapporteur (2022) stresses importance of older Indigenous persons
- Participation in urban planning decision-making
- Role of elders highlighted
- "Seven generations" thinking

**Indigenous Climate Hub (March 2025):**
- "Decolonizing Urban and Regional Planning"
- Reimagining education with decolonization mindset
- Haudenosaunee knowledge stewardship
- Infrastructure adaptation

**Vancouver Precedent (Jan 2026):**
- "Indigenous resurgence in urban parks"
- VBPR and MST Nations collaboration
- "Formalize Indigenous self-determination"
- Precedent-setting approach

**2024-2025 Highlight Report:**
- Urban Indigenous focus
- First Nations, Inuit, Métis perspectives
- Women, girls, 2SLGBTQI+ people included

**Key Framing:** Indigenous knowledge systems have 10,000+ years of place-based wisdom — cities should learn from them.

## Synthesis: Community Knowledge for Living Cities

| Knowledge Source | Role | Living City Application |
|-----------------|------|------------------------|
| Citizen Science | Monitoring, data | Community-owned environmental data |
| Indigenous Knowledge | Wisdom, systems | Long-term thinking, nature integration |
| Local Communities | Place knowledge | Neighborhood-level design input |

**Living City Design:**

1. **Citizen Science Integration:**
   - Community sensor networks
   - Air quality monitoring by residents
   - Water quality testing accessible
   - Biodiversity observation (iNaturalist, eBird)
   - Data owned by community

2. **Indigenous Knowledge:**
   - Consult Indigenous communities in all planning
   - Not just cultural heritage — governance participation
   - Seven generations thinking applied
   - Nature-based solutions from traditional knowledge
   - Decolonized planning education

3. **Combined Approach:**
   - Traditional ecological knowledge + modern sensors
   - Elder wisdom + youth technology skills
   - Community data + professional analysis
   - Place-based knowledge respected

**Metric:**
- % of environmental data from citizen science
- Indigenous representation in planning decisions
- Adoption of nature-based solutions from traditional knowledge
