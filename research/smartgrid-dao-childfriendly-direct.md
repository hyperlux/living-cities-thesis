## DAO Governance 2025

**Core Question:**
- "Can Decentralized Governance Really Work?" (LCX Sept 2025)

**Voting Design:**
- On-chain voting: recorded as blockchain transaction
- Off-chain voting: third-party platforms
- "Plausibly most crucial governance design choice"

**Research Findings:**

**Harvard Business School (Oct 2025):**
- "May not democratize shareholder voting as much as regulators hoped"
- Reality vs. promise examined

**Frontiers in Blockchain (2025):**
- Delegated voting scoping review (8 citations)
- Multi-tiered governance structures
- Decision-support mechanisms
- "More inclusive and context-aware" governance needed

**ACM Study (Nov 2025):**
- "Novel organizational structure"
- "Decentralized, transparent governance"
- Voting power and participation issues
- Controversies documented

**Working Examples:**
- ENS DAO (Ethereum Name Service)
- Decentralized domain ownership

**Implications:** DAOs offer tools but require careful design to avoid power concentration.

## Child-Friendly Cities 2025-2026

**New Global Guide (WHO/UNICEF/UN-Habitat Jan 2026):**
- "Put children at the centre of urban design"
- "Public spaces essential to children's health, development, well-being"
- Response to shrinking safe play spaces in growing cities

**UNICEF Child Friendly Cities Initiative:**
- Network in 40+ countries
- Municipal governments, civil society, private sector, academia, media, children
- "Practical governance framework"
- "Help communities take action for and with children"

**Clean Cities Campaign Ranking 2025:**
- "Streets For Kids, Cities For All"
- Child-friendly transport as key metric
- Prioritizing children in urban mobility

**15-Minute City Connection (OECD Aug 2025):**
- "Planning for Play: Designing Urban Space to Welcome Back Families"
- Schools, parks, daily needs within short walk/ride
- Play-centered design supports broader sustainability vision

**Core Principle:**
- "Safe streets and parks, supportive communities"
- "Children can play safely in parks, walk"

## Synthesis: Technology + Governance + Design for All Ages

| Organ | Smart Grid | DAO Governance | Child-Friendly |
|-------|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| Energy | Community battery, AI management | Energy cooperative voting | Safe play near infrastructure |
| Governance | Grid coordination | Transparent decisions | Child participation |
| Mobility | EV charging networks | Transport DAO possible | Safe walking routes |
| Land | Storage siting | Land trust voting | Play streets, parks |
| Care | Hospital backup power | Health DAO governance | Health access |

**Living City Design Principles:**

1. **Smart Grid:** Every neighborhood should have battery storage + AI grid management
2. **DAO Governance:** Transparent voting on community decisions (with careful design to avoid power concentration)
3. **Child-Friendly:** Every child within 5-minute walk of safe play space

**Metric:**
- % renewable + storage coverage
- Governance participation rate
- % of streets safe for child play
