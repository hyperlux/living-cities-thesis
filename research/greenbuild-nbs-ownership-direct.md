# Green Building Certifications, Nature-Based Solutions, Worker Ownership — Direct Research Feb 20

## Green Building Certifications 2025

**Major Systems Compared:**

| System | Focus | Key Requirement |
|--------|-------|-----------------|
| LEED | Holistic sustainability | Points across categories |
| Passive House | Energy efficiency | ≤15 kWh/m² heating |
| WELL | Human health | Air, water, light, comfort |
| BREEAM | UK-origin sustainability | Assessment methodology |
| Living Building Challenge | Regenerative | Net-positive energy |

**MDPI Comparative Assessment (2025):**
- Triple Bottom Line (TBL) framework comparison
- 6 citations
- Analyzing performance across social, environmental, economic

**Key Differences (TBDA March 2025):**
- LEED: Broad sustainability checklist
- Passive House (Phius): Energy performance focus
- Living Building Challenge: Most rigorous, regenerative
- ZERH: Zero energy ready standard

**Choosing Between (Ecohome Guide):**
- Compares real costs
- Health benefits
- Resale values
- Region-specific advice (USA, Canada, UK, Australia, NZ)

**Key Insight:** LEED Platinum vs Passive House serve different purposes — one broad, one energy-focused. Both "gold standard" but not interchangeable.

## Nature-Based Solutions 2025

**Definition (PNAS):**
- "Forefront of addressing climate change impacts"
- Also called: green infrastructure, urban nature, ecosystem-based adaptations
- Environmental restoration/conservation

**Applications (Ecologic Sept 2025):**
- Green roofs
- Urban forests
- Permeable pavements
- Benefits: reduce heat, prevent flooding, store carbon, restore biodiversity

**Framework (ScienceDirect 2025):**
- Ecosystem services framework
- "Urban naturalisation actions"
- Contributing to multifunctionality

**Evidence Review (Springer 2025):**
- 115 peer-reviewed studies analyzed (PRISMA)
- Urban greening most common intervention (80%)
- Spatially informed NbS enhance ecosystem services

**Challenges (Nature 2025):**
- "Often fail to deliver promised impact"
- Despite potential for climate change, biodiversity, social equity
- Need better implementation

## Worker Ownership Transition 2025

**The "Silver Tsunami":**
- Wave of retiring private business owners
- Many without succession plans
- Threatens firms, workers, communities

**Employee Ownership as Solution (Harvard):**
- "Ensuring survival of companies"
- "Saving jobs"
- "Sparing local economies from economic strain"

**Employee Ownership Month (October):**
- Thousands of employee-owned companies in US
- Growing number of founders choosing this path

**ESOP Developments:**
- Employee Ownership Fairness Act of 2025 proposed
- Aims to amend ERISA
- Allow participants to fully benefit from ownership allocations

**DOL State Programs:**
- State Employee Ownership Programs (SEOPs)
- Educate public
- Support business transitions
- Grants and tax credits available

**Democratic Ownership (Stir to Action):**
- "Truly democratic businesses"
- Ownership remains with active workers
- Founder can step away, workers continue

## Synthesis: Standards + Nature + Ownership for Living Cities

| Domain | Best Practice | Living City Application |
|--------|--------------|------------------------|
| Buildings | Passive House + Living Building | All new construction meets both |
| Landscape | Nature-based solutions | 30% green infrastructure |
| Economy | Worker ownership | All businesses worker-owned |

**Living City Design:**

1. **Building Standards:**
   - Passive House energy performance required
   - Living Building Challenge for public buildings
   - WELL certification principles throughout
   - Zero net energy standard

2. **Nature-Based Infrastructure:**
   - Urban forest canopy 40%+
   - Permeable surfaces majority
   - Green roofs on all buildings
   - Bioswales instead of storm drains

3. **Worker Ownership:**
   - No absentee ownership allowed
   - All businesses worker or community owned
   - Succession to workers, not sale
   - Democratic governance required

**Metric:**
- % buildings meeting Passive House
- % land as green infrastructure
- % businesses worker-owned
