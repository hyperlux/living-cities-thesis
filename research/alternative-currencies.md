# Alternative Currencies and Local Exchange Systems: 2025 Status Report

## Executive Summary

Alternative and local currencies represent diverse experiments in monetary design, ranging from paper-based local pounds to digital mutual credit systems. This research examines the current state of major systems worldwide, with hard data on circulation, merchant participation, and economic impact.

## 1. Bristol Pound (UK) — CLOSED

### Status: **Ceased operations (2020-2021)**

| Digital system closure | August 2020 |
| Paper currency withdrawn | September 30, 2021 |

### Why It Failed
- Could not raise sufficient funds for Bristol Pay successor project
- Declining usage from 2017 onwards
- Reduced council financial support from 2018
- General shift from cash to electronic payments
- Research in 2017 suggested it was "too small to effect significant change"

## 2. Chiemgauer (Germany) — ACTIVE

### Status: **Operational since 2003**

The Chiemgauer is one of the world's longest-running and most successful regional currencies, operating in Bavaria, Germany. Named after the Chiemgau region around Chiemsee lake.

### 2025 Statistics
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Estimated users | **500,000** (within 50km of Prien) |
| Annual turnover | **€7 million** |
| Money supply | **€1,076,790** (Jan 2022) |
| Participating businesses | ~416 (declining from 561 in 2015) |
| Total registered users | ~3,766 |

### Historical Growth
| Year | Users | Businesses | Turnover | Money Supply |
|------|-------|------------|----------|--------------|
| 2006 | 1,735 | 540 | €1.27M | €119,000 |
| 2010 | 3,049 | 602 | €5.00M | €495,000 |

| 2022 | 3,766 | 416 | ~€7M | €1,076,790 |

### Key Features

**Demurrage (negative interest):**
- Paper: 3% every six months (6% annual)
- Digital: 0.016% daily (6% annual)
- Grace period: First 90 days exempt
- Purpose: Encourages spending, increases velocity of money

**Velocity of money:**
- 2.4x to 3.2x faster circulation than euros
- 54% of businesses never convert Chiemgauer to euros

**Exchange mechanics:**
- €100 → 100 Chiemgauer (consumers)
- 100 Chiemgauer → €95 (businesses, minus VAT)
- 5% commission funds: 2% administration, 3% to nonprofits

**Nonprofit support:**
- €65,600 nonprofit revenue (2015)
- Optional 3% donation when purchasing Chiemgauer
- 3% from business redemptions

### Barriers to Growth (2025)
- **Tax law:** Businesses must pay taxes in euros
- **Wage law:** German law requires euro payments to employees
- Founder Christian Gelleri reports turnover is "saturated"

### Governance
- Democratic assembly (Chiemgauer e.V.)
- Board elected every two years
- Rules changeable through member voting
- All users are members; voting requires small annual fee

## 4. LETS Systems (Global) — MIXED STATUS

### Overview

Local Exchange Trading Systems (LETS) are locally-organized, non-profit mutual credit networks. Created by Michael Linton in 1983 in Comox Valley, British Columbia.

### Global Presence (via Community Exchange System)
As of 2019, CES network spans **99 countries** including:

| Region | Active Communities |
|--------|-------------------|
| South Africa | 62 |
| Australia | 31 |
| Argentina | 11 |
| Brazil | 14 |
| Colombia | 13 |
| Chile | 9 |
| Germany | 11 |
| UK | Multiple via LETSLINK UK |
| Netherlands | ~55 (2024) |

### Historical Peak (UK)
- 1992: 5 LETS in Great Britain
- 1995: 350 LETS with 30,000 members, £2 million turnover
- Movement waned after 1990s peak

### Current Networks
- **Community Exchange System (CES):** Cape Town-based global network
- **Community Forge:** Geneva-based platform
- **IntegralCES:** Spanish network

### Core Principles (Linton's definition)
1. Cost of service (community for community)
2. Consent (voluntary participation)
3. Disclosure (transparent balances)
4. Equivalence to national currency
5. No interest

**Note:** 1996 survey found only 13% of LETS actually practiced equivalence; most created alternative valuation systems.

### Decline Factors
- Slow adaptation to internet
- Belief in decentralization/localization
- Lack of funds for technology
- Loss of key networkers
- Shift to other designs (time banks, voucher schemes)

---

## 5. Mutual Credit Networks

## 7. Ithaca Hours (US) — DISCONTINUED

## 9. Cryptocurrency-Based Local Currencies

### Grassroots Economics / Sarafu Network (Kenya) — ACTIVE

**Founded:** 2010 (Grassroots Economics Foundation)

**Model:** Community Asset Vouchers (CAVs) via blockchain

**How it works:**
1. Communities create vouchers representing commitments
2. Vouchers are pooled together (Commitment Pooling)
3. Acts as interest-free credit
4. Supplements gaps in national currency
5. Operates on [Sarafu Network](https://sarafu.network)

**Reported Impacts (Kenya):**
| Metric | Change |
|--------|--------|
| Trust increase | +77% |
| Gifting increase | +347% |
| Environmental activities | +57% |
| School attendance | +23% |
| Crime/corruption decrease | -25% |
| Jobs created | +17% |
| Sales revenue | +37% |
| Food security | +78% |

### Other Crypto Local Currencies
- **Various blockchain-based experiments** globally
- Most remain small-scale pilots
- Challenge: balancing decentralization with local community needs
- Many tied to broader DeFi or token ecosystems

---

## 10. Economic Impact Analysis

### The Local Multiplier Effect

According to New Economics Foundation research:
- Money re-spent locally = equivalent to attracting new money
- At supermarket chains: **80%+ leaves area immediately**
- Local currencies keep value circulating within community

### Velocity of Money
| Currency | Velocity Multiple vs National Currency |
|----------|---------------------------------------|
| Chiemgauer | 2.4x - 3.2x faster than Euro |
| WIR | Counter-cyclical stabilization effect |
| LETS/Time Banks | Not directly comparable (mutual credit) |

### Key Success Factors
1. **Full-time networker/advocate** (critical per Glover)
2. **Business participation** (critical mass needed)
3. **Integration with daily transactions** (convenience)
4. **Digital payment options** (adapting to cashless trend)
5. **Democratic governance** (community ownership)
6. **Clear value proposition** (discounts, community benefits)

### Common Failure Points
1. Loss of key organizers/evangelists
2. Failure to adapt to digital payments
3. Insufficient merchant network
4. Regulatory/tax complications
5. Competition from national currency convenience
6. Funding sustainability

---

## 11. Regulatory Considerations

### Tax Treatment
- Generally: Transactions in local currency remain taxable
- Business income in alternative currency = taxable income
- Time banks: Controversial; proponents argue social exchanges non-taxable
- Businesses often required to accept partial national currency for tax payments

### Legal Status
- Most local currencies are **not legal tender**
- Participation is voluntary
- Bank of England (UK) acknowledges local currencies' existence and role
- Germany: Barriers include mandatory euro tax and wage payments

---

## 12. Current Trends (2025)

### Surviving Systems
- **WIR Bank:** Strongest, institutional, 92-year track record
- **Chiemgauer:** Most successful demurrage currency, saturated growth
- **Time Banks:** Growing globally, 6.8M+ hours exchanged in UK
- **Sardex:** Expanding nationally in Italy
- **Grassroots Economics:** Innovative blockchain approach in developing nations

### Closed/Declining
- **Bristol Pound:** Closed 2020-2023
- **Ithaca Hours:** Effectively discontinued
- **BerkShares:** Declining participation
- **Many UK Transition Town currencies:** Closed or minimal activity

### Emerging Models
- **Commitment Pooling** (Grassroots Economics)
- **Community Asset Vouchers** on blockchain
- **Hybrid digital/mutual credit systems**
- **Mobile-first platforms** (essential for adoption)

## Key Takeaways for Urban Economic Resilience

1. **Scale matters:** WIR (62,000 members) demonstrates long-term viability requires critical mass

2. **Institutional integration:** Success correlates with ability to pay taxes, utilities, and major purchases

3. **Digital-first:** Cash-only systems increasingly obsolete

4. **Full-time management:** Every successful system has dedicated coordinators

5. **Demurrage works:** Chiemgauer's negative interest increases velocity without inflation

6. **Mutual credit:** Zero-interest systems like WIR and Sardex function as B2B liquidity solutions

7. **Community building:** Non-monetary benefits (trust, social capital) often exceed economic impact

8. **Realistic expectations:** Even successful systems remain "complementary" — none have replaced national currencies
