## Synthesis: Housing for All Stages of Life

| Principle | Housing First | Universal Design | Intergenerational |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Core Value | Dignity | Accessibility | Connection |
| Target | Homeless → housed | All abilities | All ages |
| Method | Housing then services | Design from start | Mix populations |
| Result | End homelessness | No barriers | Reduced isolation |

**Living City Application:**

1. **Housing First:** Every Living City guarantees housing
   - No one unhoused
   - Support services follow housing

2. **Universal Design:** Every building accessible
   - No retrofit needed
   - Designed for full spectrum of ability

3. **Intergenerational:** Every neighborhood mixed-age
   - Students with elders
   - Children with seniors
   - Mutual support networks

**Design Principle:** Living Cities should be designed so that:
- Everyone has housing (Housing First)
- Everyone can access everything (Universal Design)
- Everyone has cross-generational connection (Intergenerational)

**Metric:**
- 0% unhoused rate
- 100% buildings universal design compliant
- % of housing in intergenerational settings
