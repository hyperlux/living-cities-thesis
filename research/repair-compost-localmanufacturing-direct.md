# Right to Repair, Composting, Local Manufacturing — Direct Research Feb 20

## Right to Repair 2025-2026

**EU Directive:**
- Adopted June 13, 2024
- Entered force July 30, 2024
- Member States must transpose by end of June 2026
- "Consumers to request that manufacturers repair products"

**US REPAIR Act:**
- S.1379 (119th Congress 2025-2026)
- "Right to Equitable and Professional Auto Industry Repair Act"
- Moving through Congress

**Legislation Goals (Reclaimit Sept 2025):**
- "Promote more sustainable consumption"
- "Reducing environmental impact"
- "Boost the repair economy"

**Timeline:**
- EU Repair Directive 2024/1799
- Starting July 31, 2026 in full force
- Products must be technically repairable

**Impact:** Manufacturers required to make repair possible — extends product life, reduces waste.

## Urban Composting 2025

**EU Bio-Waste Status (Zero Waste Europe Jan 2025):**
- "Mandatory yet makeshift"
- Bio-waste management across EU
- Nearly 90% of participants began composting
- 211+ tonnes organic waste prevented from landfills annually
- 70% of households reduced waste

**Scale (NetZeroCities Nov 2025):**
- Only 40% of biodegradable waste currently composted
- "Solution which cities can easily implement"

**Compost Revolution:**
- International Compost Awareness Week 2025 (May 4-10)
- Cities worldwide implementing programs
- Sustainable waste management strategies

**São Paulo Model (ScienceDirect):**
- "Urban community-driven composting model"
- "Innovative approach to local waste management"
- Citizen engagement
- Shared spaces creation
- "Viable solution to urban organic waste challenges"

**Milan Urban Food Policy Pact 2025:**
- "Clear shift in food waste strategies"
- "Moving beyond recovery to circular systems"
- Combining strategies

## Local/Distributed Manufacturing 2025

**3D Printing Revolution (Logistics IT June 2025):**
- "Localised manufacturing reshaping global trade"
- Robotic large-format additive manufacturing
- "Shifted production on-site"
- "Eliminating reliance on Far East"

**Distributed AM Hubs (UK Battle Factory Sept 2025):**
- "Additive manufacturing offers fundamentally different approach"
- Distributed hub model
- Local production capacity

**HP Analysis:**
- "Local Manufacturing Is the Next Global Advantage"
- High-mix, low-volume production
- Compact 3D print labs
- "Agile, on-demand manufacturing"
- One operator managing three machines

**Sectors Leading:**
- Aerospace
- Defense
- Construction
- Industrial design
- Customization-heavy products

**IDTechEx:**
- "3D printing supports distributed manufacturing"
- "Scale-up of local manufacturing industries"
- Metal additive manufacturing growing

**Key Framing:** Make things where they're needed — reduce shipping, increase customization.

## Synthesis: Repair + Compost + Make for Living Cities

| System | Linear Model | Living City Model |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| Products | Buy, use, discard | Buy, use, repair, use more |
| Organic Waste | Landfill | Compost → soil |
| Manufacturing | Centralized, shipped | Local, on-demand |

**Living City Design:**

1. **Repair Infrastructure:**
   - Repair cafés in every neighborhood
   - Right to repair enforced
   - Parts availability required
   - Repair training programs
   - Products designed for repairability

2. **Composting Systems:**
   - All organic waste composted locally
   - Community composting sites
   - Compost returned to urban gardens
   - No organic waste to landfill
   - 90%+ household participation target

3. **Local Manufacturing:**
   - Fab labs / makerspaces throughout
   - 3D printing for spare parts
   - On-demand production
   - Reduce shipping needs
   - Custom products locally made

**Circular Flow:**
- Product breaks → Repair café fixes it
- Food waste → Community compost
- Compost → Urban garden
- Garden → Local food
- Need spare part → Local fab lab prints it

**Metric:**
- Product repair rate (% repaired vs replaced)
- Organic waste diversion rate
- % of goods manufactured locally
