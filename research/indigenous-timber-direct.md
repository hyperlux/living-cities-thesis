# Indigenous Governance & Mass Timber — Direct Research Feb 20

## Two Row Wampum (Kaswentha)

**The Principle:**
- Historic agreement between Indigenous peoples (Haudenosaunee) and Dutch (1613)
- Two parallel rows: two vessels traveling same direction, never crossing
- Key principles: mutual respect, non-interference, peaceful coexistence
- Each nation maintains sovereignty while sharing the river

**Current Relevance (2025):**
- Invoked in Ontario Bill 5 opposition (May 2025)
- "Protect Ontario by Unleashing our Economy Act" accused of violating Two Row principles
- Section 35 Constitution Act 1982 recognizes Aboriginal treaty rights

**Modern Application:**
- Extended Two Row Wampum Convention (INKG)
- "Landmark treaty reaffirming sovereignty of Indigenous Nations in global economy"
- Strengthens international trade while upholding non-interference
- Bridge between historic treaty-making and modern governance

**Relevance for Living Cities:**
- Model for how different governance systems can coexist
- Alternative to assimilation or separation
- Parallel sovereignty: shared space, different journeys
- Could inform relationship between Living Cities and existing jurisdictions

## Mass Timber Construction 2025-2026

**Market Status:**
- 2025 is "pivotal year" for mass timber construction
- Growing at ~20% per year in US and Europe
- Ecological benefit: stores carbon AND emits less carbon during manufacture than steel/concrete

**Tallest Buildings (Jan 2025):**
1. **Ascent (Milwaukee, USA)** — 284.1 feet (86.6m), currently world's tallest
2. **Mjøstårnet (Norway)** — 85.4 meters, showcases wood competing with high-rise
3. **Sara Kulturhus (Sweden)** — 75m, cultural center
4. Plus new completions 2025...

**2025 Completions:**
- World Expo 2025 (Osaka, Japan) — major visibility
- Timber Square (Bankside, UK)
- Walworth Town Hall (Southwark, UK)
- Paradise (Lambeth, UK)
- Hosta (Paris, France)

**Amsterdam Green Deal:**
- Green Deal Timber Construction 2021-2025
- All 32 municipalities committed to 20% timber housing target
- Part of carbon-neutral strategy

**Key Stats:**
- Concrete production = ~8% of global CO2 emissions
- Mass timber can be carbon-negative (stores carbon throughout building life)
- CLT (Cross-Laminated Timber) enables high-rise wood construction

## Synthesis: Living City Materials

**Indigenous Governance + Mass Timber** both offer alternatives to dominant paradigms:

1. **Two Row Wampum**: Different systems coexisting in shared space
   - Living Cities can exist alongside conventional cities
   - Each follows its own path while sharing resources

2. **Mass Timber**: Regenerative material cycle
   - Trees sequester carbon while growing
   - Building stores carbon
   - End-of-life: can decompose or be recycled
   - Closed loop vs. extractive (concrete/steel)

**Connection to Nine Organs:**
- Shelter (Housing): Mass timber for construction
- Production (Making): Local timber processing
- Governance (Collective): Two Row as model for parallel sovereignty
- Energy: Wood waste → biogas/thermal

**Design Implication:** Living Cities should specify mass timber or bamboo as primary structural materials, with governance that allows parallel sovereignty alongside host nations.
