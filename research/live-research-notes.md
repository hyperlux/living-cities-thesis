# Live Research Notes - Feb 2026 Scan

## Network States (2025-2026 Status)

### Praxis
- $525M raised (Jan 2026), mostly from GEM Digital
- 151,068 members claimed
- Mediterranean city planned but location TBD
- CEO Dryden Brown: "homeschooled professional surfer with Austrian economics"
- Controversial: anti-LGBTQ rants, "white genocide" conspiracy promotion
- FT calls vision "unrealistic"
- Identifies as "world's first Network State"

### Próspera
- Honduras ZEDE still operating on Roatán
- $11B lawsuit filed against Honduran government
- Actively pursuing Africa expansion (SE and West Africa "racing")
- Shuns "network state" label per FT
- Model: special economic zone with own governance

### Itana (formerly Talent City)
- Nigeria, 50 miles east of Lagos
- Pronomos Capital investment
- Similar model to Próspera

### Key Insight for Thesis
These projects are real but controversial. Our Living Cities thesis should:
- Distinguish from libertarian "escape" narrative
- Emphasize community ownership vs investor extraction
- Focus on regeneration, not just deregulation

## Distributed Manufacturing (2025-2026)

### Market Status
- Microfactory market growing rapidly
- Urban integration accelerating
- Examples: Vancouver electronics labs (30% faster prototypes), Alberta medical devices

### ChopValue
- US microfactory network expanding
- "Hundreds more" planned for 2025+ scale
- Hyperlocal model working

### Key Models
- **Arrival** (UK EV): Decentralized microfactories with robots
- **Ryvid**: Motorcycle microfactory for distributed manufacturing
- **WEF endorsement**: Microfactories as "future of manufacturing"

### Academic Work
- Springer 2025: "Micro-Factory in the City" - modular last-mile customization
- ResearchGate: Urban manufacturing enables circular economy

### Integration for Thesis
- Microfactories aren't just production—they're resilience + meaning infrastructure
- Modular/mobile deployment = fast scaling
- Last-mile customization = neighborhood-scale relevance

## AI Governance & Democracy (2025-2026)

### Major Initiatives
- **Coalition for AI Governance**: Launched at AI Summit, 10,000 citizens from 100+ countries planned
- **Netherlands Citizens' Assembly**: Government required to respond within 6 months, Parliament debate
- **Mozilla Democracy x AI Cohort 2026**: Incubator for civic AI tech
- **Carnegie Endowment**: "AI can unlock public wisdom" - participatory policymaking in 2 weeks vs months

### Key Tools
- **Computational Democracy Project**: LLM-powered deliberative analysis
- **OECD guidance**: AI in civic participation and open government
- **MIT Media Lab**: Framework for analyzing collective idea evolution in assemblies

### Key Quote
"Together, these efforts suggest a future in which public voice is not limited to elections or symbolic comment periods, but becomes a regular, rigorous part of democratic governance."

### Integration for Thesis
- Liquid democracy is becoming practical
- AI enables scale + speed for deliberation
- Citizens assemblies gaining legitimacy (Netherlands, France, Ireland precedents)

## Post-Scarcity Economics (2025-2026)

### UBS vs UBI Debate
- **UBS (Universal Basic Services)**: Healthcare, education, housing, transport, care, information
- **UBI (Universal Basic Income)**: Cash transfers
- **Hybrid approaches**: Both together

### Key Sources
- Autonomy.work UBS paper (2025)
- Aaron Benanav: "Post-Scarcity Economics" seminar
- Aaron Bastani: Fully Automated Luxury Communism vision

### Degrowth Connection
- Degrowth supports UBS over UBI
- Reduces need for high private incomes
- Aligns with circular economy

### Key Concept: "Post-Scarcity Paradox"
AI/automation could enable abundance, but distribution mechanisms unclear. Current systems may concentrate rather than distribute gains.

### Integration for Thesis
- "Dignity floor" = UBS + partial UBI
- Multiple currencies diversify beyond cash
- Community ownership captures value locally

## Gaps Identified

1. **Governance transition path**: How do existing cities adopt these systems? Need specific 5-10 year roadmap.
2. **Counter-arguments**: Need to address "utopian" criticism directly
3. **Failure modes**: More specific on what kills living cities
4. **Scale questions**: Does this work at 50k? 500k? 5M?
5. **Climate integration**: More on resilience to climate disruption
6. **Migration/displacement**: What about people who can't/won't stay?
