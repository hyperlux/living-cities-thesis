# Heat Mortality & Community Land Trusts — Direct Research Feb 20

## Urban Heat Mortality 2025

**European Scale (LSHTM Sept 2025):**
- Climate change-driven summer heat caused 16,500 additional deaths
- Across European urban centers
- June-August 2025
- Heat waves not always recorded as heat deaths

**NYC Data (2025 Heat Mortality Report):**
- "More than 500 New Yorkers die prematurely because of hot weather"
- Average annual (2018-2022): 525 heat-related deaths
- 3% of all deaths during warm season (May-September)

**Global Scale (ScienceDirect 2025):**
- "Over 178,000 global deaths associated with 2023 heatwave"
- 23 deaths per million
- Southern and Eastern Europe hardest hit

**Building Heat Vulnerability:**
- "Building Heat Vulnerable Index (BHVI)" introduced
- Maps urban overheating mortality risk
- Building-level assessment
- Socioeconomic factors matter

**EU Projections:**
- "Duration and intensity of heatwaves dangerous to human health are increasing"
- "Projected to further increase substantially"

**Key Framing:** Heat kills people — urban design determines who dies.

## Community Land Trusts 2025

**The Model:**
- "Shared ownership" system
- Makes homeownership "permanently more affordable"
- Separates land price from residence price
- Non-profit holds land in perpetuity

**Milwaukee Example (Aug 2025):**
- "Forever affordable housing"
- Low-income buyers served
- Community land trust model working

**New York State:**
- Community Land Trust Support Program (HCR)
- Funding for long-term affordability
- Low- and moderate-income focus

**Scale (TIME):**
- "Just one model of affordable housing"
- Utilized across United States
- Growing network

**State College CLT:**
- "Permanently affordable homes"
- "So more people can live and thrive in our community"
- Active applications

**Network for Public Health Law:**
- CLTs "drive the cost of housing down"
- Especially effective in areas with rapid economic change
- Appreciating land values counteracted

**Asset Funders (Aug 2025):**
- "Investing in Lasting Housing Affordability"
- "Hold land, often in perpetuity"
- Permanently affordable housing

**Key Framing:** Land should never be speculative — CLTs lock in affordability forever.

## Synthesis: Heat Safety + Housing Security for Living Cities

| Issue | Current System | Living City |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| Heat Deaths | 16,500+/year Europe | Design eliminates heat risk |
| Housing | Speculation, displacement | CLT permanent affordability |
| Vulnerability | Low-income suffer most | Universal heat protection |

**Living City Design:**

1. **Heat Death Prevention:**
   - 40%+ tree canopy for cooling
   - Passive house design (no AC needed)
   - Cooling centers accessible to all
   - Building Heat Vulnerability Index used
   - Socioeconomic factors addressed

2. **Community Land Trusts:**
   - All land in collective ownership
   - Homes affordable in perpetuity
   - No speculation possible
   - Community-controlled
   - Anti-displacement built-in

3. **Combined Approach:**
   - CLT housing built to passive standards
   - No one dies from heat OR loses home
   - Vulnerability mapped and addressed
   - Design for everyone, not just wealthy

**Connection:**
- Heat deaths concentrate in low-income housing
- Poor housing = poor heat resilience
- CLT + Passive House = Heat-safe affordable housing

**Metric:**
- Heat-related deaths per 100,000
- % of housing in CLT/collective ownership
- % of buildings meeting passive cooling standards
