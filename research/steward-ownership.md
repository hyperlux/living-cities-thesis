# Steward Ownership & Purpose Trusts: Deep Research (2025)

*Research compiled: February 2025*

---

## Executive Summary

Steward ownership represents a proven alternative to conventional ownership models, combining two binding principles: **self-determination** (control stays with people connected to the mission) and **purpose-orientation** (profits serve purpose, not extraction). This model spans from century-old German foundations to 2022's landmark Patagonia restructuring, demonstrating viability across scales from startups to €90B+ corporations.

## Core Principles & Definitions

### Two Binding Principles of Steward Ownership

**1. Self-Determination**
- Company cannot become an object of speculation
- Remains independent in the long term
- Control stays with people connected to the company and its mission
- Cannot be inherited, bought, or speculated upon
- Passed on "in trust" to successor stewards

**2. Purpose-Orientation**
- Profits are means to an end, not an end in themselves
- Value created cannot be extracted by shareholders for personal benefit
- Profits are reinvested, donated, or used to cover capital costs
- Serves company's mission and long-term development

### Enterprise Foundation Definition

Enterprise foundations are:
- Independent, self-governing entities with **no owners**
- Characterized by long time-horizons, philanthropic goals
- Absence of personal profit motives
- Often concentrated investment in a single firm/group
- Foundation controls the company (not vice versa)

│              PATAGONIA, INC.                           │
│     Private Benefit Corporation (~$1.5B revenue)       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Mechanics

| Element | Structure |
|---------|-----------|
| **Voting Stock** | ~2% → Patagonia Purpose Trust |
| **Nonvoting Stock** | ~98% → Holdfast Collective |
| **Control** | Trust controls company via voting rights |
| **Profits** | Flow to Holdfast for climate/land work |
| **Tax Treatment** | $17M gift tax on voting stock transfer; nonvoting gift to 501(c)(4) avoids gift tax |

### Why This Structure?

**Yvon Chouinard's Statement:**
> "Earth is now our only shareholder."

**Goals:**
1. Use profits to address climate change
2. Protect undeveloped land
3. Maintain company independence from acquisition
4. Prevent IPO or sale to extractive owners
5. Preserve mission beyond founder's lifetime

### 501(c)(4) Choice vs 501(c)(3)

- 501(c)(4) = social welfare nonprofit
- Can engage in unlimited lobbying/political activity
- No deduction for donors, but more operational freedom
- Suited for advocacy-heavy climate work

### Comparison to Traditional Exit

| Traditional Exit | Patagonia Model |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Sell to acquirer or IPO | Permanent mission lock |
| Founder cashes out | Founder gives up wealth |
| New owners may change mission | Charter-bound purpose |
| Profits to shareholders | Profits to planet |

---

## Exit to Community (E2C) Examples

Exit to Community represents a growing movement for companies to mature toward community accountability rather than traditional acquisition/IPO exits.

## Legal Mechanisms & Protections

### Dual-Class Share Structures

**Mechanism:** Separate voting rights from economic rights
- A-shares: High voting power, typically unlisted, held by foundation
- B-shares: Low voting power, publicly tradeable
- Ratios: 10:1 (Novo Nordisk), 20:2 (Carlsberg)

**Protection:** Foundation maintains control while accessing public capital markets

### Golden Shares / Veto Shares

**Mechanism:** Special share class with veto power over:
- Sale of company
- Charter amendments
- Dividend policy changes
- Mission alterations

**Used by:** Many steward-owned startups implementing "veto share models"

### Purpose Trust (US)

**Mechanism:** 
- Trust holds voting shares
- Trustees bound by trust purpose
- Cannot be amended against purpose

**Key Feature:** Delaware statutory trust law enables this; other states vary

### 501(c)(4) Nonprofit Holding

**Mechanism:**
- Social welfare organization holds nonvoting economic interest
- Profits fund mission activities
- Tax-advantaged receipt of donations

**Limitation:** Cannot do primary purpose of private benefit

### Foundation Charter Requirements

**German Model:**
- Statutory purposes written into founding documents
- Cannot be changed except through complex legal process
- Overseen by state authorities
- Perpetual existence mandated

**Danish Model:**
- Minimum ownership thresholds (e.g., 51% voting, 25% capital)
- Purpose statements binding on foundation
- Regulatory oversight by Danish Foundation Oversight Authority

### Asset Lock / Anti-Extraction Provisions

**Purpose:** Prevent value extraction by owners/stakeholders

**Mechanisms:**
- Caps on dividends to investors (if any)
- Mandatory reinvestment requirements
- Profit distribution only for stated purposes
- Prohibition on sale to extractive buyers

---

## Key Learnings for Implementation

### Success Factors

1. **Clear Purpose Articulation**
   - Mission must be legally codified, not just stated
   - Charter/bylaws must make purpose binding

2. **Aligned Governance**
   - Board composition reflects stakeholder interests
   - Decision-making processes match values
   - Succession planning built in from start

3. **Appropriate Scale**
   - Structures can work from $3M startups to $148B foundations
   - Legal complexity increases with scale

4. **Patient Capital**
   - Traditional VC/PE incompatible with model
   - Revenue-based financing, community investment, or founder patience required
   - Crowdfunding (SAFE, direct community) can work

5. **Regulatory Environment**
   - Denmark/Germany have favorable frameworks
   - US requires creative legal structures
   - UK Employee Ownership Trust model well-established

### Common Challenges

1. **Financing Constraints**
   - Cannot offer traditional equity returns
   - May limit growth velocity
   - Requires mission-aligned capital sources

2. **Governance Complexity**
   - Multiple stakeholder interests
   - Slower decision-making possible
   - Need clear decision rights allocation

3. **Founder Wealth Sacrifice**
   - Unlike traditional exit, founder doesn't cash out
   - Patagonia: Chouinard paid $17M gift tax, gave up $3B+ valuation
   - Requires founder alignment with mission over wealth

4. **Legal Expertise**
   - Structures are not standard
   - Require specialized legal counsel
   - Ongoing compliance needs

### Implementation Pathways

**For Startups:**
- Purpose Foundation veto share model
- Cooperative structure from founding
- Community ownership from day one

**For Existing Companies:**
- Employee Ownership Trust conversion (UK/US)
- Worker cooperative conversion
- Foundation ownership transfer
- Gradual stakeholder ownership transition

**For Founders Planning Exit:**
- Purpose trust + nonprofit structure (Patagonia model)
- Sale to employee trust
- Cooperative conversion
- Community buyout

## Conclusion

Steward ownership represents a mature, proven alternative to extractive capitalism with over a century of track record at scale. The Danish and German models demonstrate long-term viability of foundation ownership for publicly-listed multinationals, while Patagonia's 2022 restructuring created a novel American template combining purpose trusts with 501(c)(4) nonprofits.

For living cities and regenerative urban development, these structures offer:
1. **Permanent mission protection** against gentrification and speculation
2. **Long-term stakeholder alignment** over short-term extraction
3. **Democratic governance** possibilities
4. **Surplus recycling** into community benefit
5. **Legal templates** adaptable to various scales and contexts

The Exit to Community movement provides practical pathways for existing organizations to transition toward community ownership, with growing case law and precedent for implementation.
