# TOD, Self-Build Housing, Decentralized Wastewater — Direct Research Feb 20

## Transit-Oriented Development 2025

**Definition:**
- Dense, mixed-use, walkable communities near transit stations
- Frequent and reliable public transportation access
- Services within walking distance
- Less car dependency

**Washington State HB 1491 (2025):**
- "One of the most ambitious statewide TOD policies in the country"
- Statewide minimum density standards near transit stops
- Increases housing supply
- Reduces carbon emissions from transportation
- Requires minimum percentage of affordable housing

**Urban Institute Analysis (Dec 2025):**
- "Mandating Density Near Transit"
- Research on TOD effectiveness
- Mixed-use and walkability benefits documented

**NSW Australia:**
- Transport Oriented Development program
- Housing SEPP requires at least 2% floor space for affordable housing
- Alternative approaches available

**ACEEE Analysis (Oct 2025):**
- Five key components for state TOD laws:
  1. Remove local barriers to dense development
  2. Expand affordable housing
  3. Improve mobility
  4. Cut climate pollution
  5. Model legislation available

**Key Insight:** TOD works best when mandated at state level to overcome local resistance.

## Self-Build & Community-Led Housing 2025

**Right to Build (UK):**
- Right to Build Task Force active
- Masterclasses on self-build delivery
- Small sites opportunities explored (Jan 2025)

**Ten-Year Plan (Red Brick March 2025):**
- "A ten-year plan for community-led housing"
- Use new towns and public land for CLH opportunities
- Government should catalyze activity
- Build institutional capacity and structures

**Types of Community-Led Housing:**
- Self-build (active construction involvement)
- Custom build (less hands-on)
- Cohousing
- Community Land Trusts
- Residents control aims, design, construction, management

**How-To Guides (Down to Earth Project):**
- 7-part series on community-led housing
- Self-build guide published
- CLH groups taking active construction roles

**Northumberland Council:**
- Community-led housing support
- Right to Build Toolkit available
- Distinguishes individual self-build from community-led

## Decentralized Wastewater Treatment 2025

**The Shift:**
- Moving from centralized to decentralized systems
- "Budget-friendly compact systems have become crucial"
- "Fit into tight spaces and blend with urban" environments

**ScienceDirect Review:**
- Critical review of decentralized wastewater treatment systems (DWTS)
- Comparing to centralized systems (CWTS)
- Moving beyond "one-size-fits-all solutions"

**Technology Advances:**
- Machine learning + explainable AI (XAI)
- Optimizing decentralized water/wastewater management
- NAMOR Project (Water Europe)

**Nature Research (2025):**
- "Towards decentralized and sustainable water and wastewater treatment"
- Contributing to SDG6 (clean water and sanitation for all)
- Advances documented

**Key Benefits:**
- Works in compact urban spaces
- Reduces infrastructure costs
- Local water cycling
- Resilience (no single point of failure)

## Synthesis: Infrastructure Design for Living Cities

| System | Centralized Model | Living City Model |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Transit | City-wide network | TOD design, 15-min access |
| Housing | Developer-built | Self-build, community-led |
| Wastewater | Central plant | Decentralized treatment |
| Water | Piped supply | Rainwater + local treatment |

**Living City Design Principles:**

1. **Transit-Oriented:**
   - All housing within 400m of transit stop
   - Mixed-use zoning
   - Minimum density requirements

2. **Self-Build Enabled:**
   - Right to build codified
   - Support structures for community-led
   - Training and resources available

3. **Decentralized Infrastructure:**
   - Neighborhood-scale wastewater treatment
   - Local water cycling
   - No massive centralized plants

**Metric:**
- % of housing within TOD zone
- % of housing community-led/self-built
- % of wastewater treated locally
