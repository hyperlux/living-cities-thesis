# 15-Minute Cities & Urban Rewilding — Direct Research Feb 20

## 15-Minute City Status 2025

**The Concept:**
- Everything needed within 15-minute walk/cycle/transit from any point
- Carlos Moreno (Sorbonne) developed concept
- Paris as prototype laboratory under Mayor Anne Hidalgo

**Academic Analysis:**
- 102 academic publications (2020-mid 2024) analyzed
- ScienceDirect systematic content analysis (2025)
- Critical debates examined through "theoretical-practical-impact lens"

**Results (Paris):**
- Traffic removal programs implemented
- Tree planting expanded
- Streets reclaimed for pedestrians/cyclists
- Proving receptive to concept

**Criticisms:**
1. **Political backlash:** UK Conservative party conference criticized as "sinister" idea that councils could "ration" road use
2. **Equity concerns:** Different neighborhoods have different 15-minute access; "probably poorer and higher crime" in some areas
3. **Conspiracy theories:** Falsely linked to "climate lockdowns" and surveillance
4. **Overlooked complexity:** Diverse social needs, geographical conditions not addressed in simple model

**Key Insight (Routes Journal 2025):**
- Assessed positive and negative impacts
- Not inherently good or bad — implementation matters
- Works best when paired with transit investment

## Urban Rewilding 2025-2026

**Definition:**
- Reintroducing native plants and animals
- Reconnecting green corridors
- Letting ecosystems regenerate with minimal intervention
- Moving beyond "beautification" to biodiversity and resilience

**Global Movement:**
- Singapore, Copenhagen cited as forward-thinking examples
- "Cities are weaving green spaces into urban fabric"
- "Welcoming wildlife home"

**2025 Status:**
- "Green revolution" in urban landscapes
- Replacing concrete with wildflower alleys
- Wetland corridors
- Public green sanctuaries
- Rooftop forests

**Key Elements (BioScience):**
- Originally about "3Cs": cores, corridors, carnivores
- Urban adaptation: smaller scale but same principles
- Focus on regulatory roles of wildlife in urban ecosystems

**Rewilding Europe (2025):**
- Protected areas have huge potential to "make them wilder"
- Not just preservation but active restoration

**Examples:**
- Wildlife corridors connecting fragmented habitats
- Native plantings replacing lawns
- Wetland restoration for flood management
- Pollinator pathways through cities

## Synthesis: Living Cities as 15-Minute Rewilded Neighborhoods

**Combine both concepts:**

1. **15-minute accessibility** ensures human needs met locally
   - Reduces car dependency
   - Frees road space for green corridors
   
2. **Rewilding** restores ecological function
   - Wildlife corridors through former roads/parking
   - Native food forests instead of ornamental lawns
   - Wetlands for stormwater + biodiversity

**Design Principle:** Every Living City zone should be:
- 15-minute accessible for all human services
- Part of continuous wildlife corridor network
- Mix of productive landscapes (food) and wild zones

**Metric:** % of land that is permeable + % of services within 15 minutes
