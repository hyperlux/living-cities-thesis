# Meaning Infrastructure Research — Feb 20, 2026

## Time Banking

**Fureai Kippu (Japan)**
- Established 1973 — pioneering elder care time banking
- Combines time credits with cash payments
- Faced stagnation since 2000 (competition from Long-Term Care Insurance Act)
- Model still referenced globally as proof-of-concept

**UK Time Banking**
- Incorporated into local governance
- Volunteers support municipal services in exchange for training/benefits
- Growing integration with public sector

**Global Status**
- Timebanks.org promoting globally
- Switzerland and Netherlands have active systems
- Germany has community currency systems being studied academically

**Key Insight:** Time banking works but struggles to scale against formal care systems. Works best as complement, not replacement.

## Men's Sheds Movement

**Scale (2025)**
- Global movement with significant presence in Australia, UK, Ireland
- Australian Men's Shed Association (AMSA) is leading org

**Impact Data**
- 97% increase in new friendships established (UKMSA research)
- Improved mental health outcomes documented
- Increased light intensity physical activity
- Reduced isolation

**Evolution**
- SGS research recommends: "Expanding inclusivity and integrating into multipurpose hubs"
- Moving beyond just "sheds" to broader community spaces
- Recognized by Australian government (Sept 2025 ministerial celebration)

**Research Base**
- PMC studies: Men's sheds as "alternative healthcare route"
- Academic papers documenting wellbeing benefits
- Canadian 2025 research on addressing older men's mental health

**Key Insight:** Men's Sheds work because they provide purpose + belonging + skills without being labeled as "mental health intervention." Stealth health.

## Repair Café Movement

**Scale (June 2025)**
- **3,652 repair cafés worldwide** (Repair Café International Foundation)
- Growing rapidly as movement
- Share and Repair Network Scotland: Impact report 2022-2025

**Drivers**
- Economic pressure (cost-saving)
- Environmental urgency (circular economy)
- Social/skill-building benefits
- Right-to-repair legislation momentum

**Integration**
- UK Circular Economy Taskforce considering repair & reuse
- Connected to Precious Plastic and other circular networks
- Rotary clubs adopting as sustainability + community building

**Key Insight:** Repair cafés achieve multiple goals simultaneously: waste reduction + skill transfer + social connection + economic savings. Multi-purpose infrastructure.

## Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend

**Current Status (2025)**
- Fund value: $79.6 billion
- 2025 dividend: $1,702/person (standard + Energy Relief Payment)
- 2023 dividend: $1,312/person
- Constitutional protection since 1976

**Evidence on Behavior**
- ScienceDirect 2025: "Exogenous increases in basic income provisions increase preventive healthcare"
- Jones and Marinescu research: labor market effects
- One critique: household income excluding UBI fell ~$4,100/year

**Political Status**
- Alaska Senate 2025: "75-25" dividend formula bill introduced
- Ongoing debate about sustainability

**Key Insight:** Alaska proves dividend model can persist for 50+ years with political support. But amount ($1,312-1,702/year) isn't life-changing — it's supplement, not replacement income.

## Implications for Living Cities

1. **Multiple mechanisms together > any single mechanism**
   - Time banking + Men's Sheds + Repair Cafés + Care Hubs = ecosystem

2. **"Stealth" approaches work**
   - Men's Sheds succeed because they don't feel like therapy
   - Repair Cafés succeed because they don't feel like activism

3. **Time-based currencies hit scaling limits**
   - Work as complement to formal systems
   - Don't expect them to replace professional care

4. **Dividend models require long-term political infrastructure**
   - Alaska's 50-year success required constitutional protection
   - Living cities need similar lock-in mechanisms

5. **3,652 repair cafés prove grassroots infrastructure can scale**
   - Started 2009 in Netherlands
   - Now global in 16 years
   - Replication protocol matters
