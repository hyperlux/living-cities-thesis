# Vertical Farming & Controlled Environment Agriculture: 2025-2026 Analysis

## Executive Summary

The vertical farming industry experienced a brutal correction in 2023-2024. Two of the three most well-funded American vertical farms—Bowery Farming and AeroFarms—either shut down entirely or went through bankruptcy. The survivors are pivoting: from premium consumer brands to equipment manufacturing (Fischer Farms), from leafy greens to higher-margin microgreens (AeroFarms post-bankruptcy), and from scale-at-all-costs to ruthless unit economics optimization.

**The verdict:** Vertical farming works for specific crops in specific markets with specific energy costs. It does not work as a general replacement for field agriculture. The industry's future lies in niche applications, not revolution.

## The Big Three: Autopsy & Survival

### Bowery Farming (FAILED - November 2024)
- **Total funding raised:** $472 million
- **Peak valuation:** $2.3 billion (2021)
- **Status:** Ceased all operations November 2024
- **Cause of death:** 
  - Weak demand for high-priced products
  - Yield losses from plant disease (leaf-eating pathogen) across multiple facilities
  - Failed acquisition deals
- **Investors included:** Google Ventures, Fidelity, Temasek, plus celebrities (Justin Timberlake, Natalie Portman, Lewis Hamilton)
- **Lesson:** Scale and celebrity investors cannot overcome fundamental unit economics problems

### AeroFarms (BANKRUPT → RESTRUCTURED)
- **Founded:** 2004 (one of the oldest players)
- **Bankruptcy:** Chapter 11 filed June 8, 2023
- **Emerged:** September 2023 with new CEO Molly Montgomery
- **Post-bankruptcy strategy:**
  - Abandoned all projects except Danville, Virginia farm
  - Pivoted from leafy greens to **microgreens** (70%+ US retail market share as of 2025)
  - Commercialized their vertical farming technology for licensing (January 2025)
  - Partnership with Costco (2024)
- **Key insight:** Microgreens command 5x-40x the price per kg of mature vegetables; this changes the economics entirely
- **Resource efficiency claims:** 90% less water, 230x less land vs field farming, 100% renewable energy

### Plenty Unlimited (OPERATIONAL)
- **Strategy:** AI-controlled modular grow systems, focus on strawberries
- **Facility:** Chesterfield, Virginia farm producing 1.8 million kg (4 million lbs) strawberries/year
- **Claims:** 97% less land, 97% less water than traditional farming
- **Notable:** One of few remaining well-funded players still pursuing scale
- **No hard profitability data publicly available**

## The Economics: Hard Numbers

### Capital Costs
- Large-scale vertical farms: **$10-30 million** for facilities of meaningful scale
- Fischer Farms' new modular approach: Designed for **rental/lease models** to eliminate upfront capital barriers
- Container farms: **$100,000-500,000** per unit depending on sophistication

### Operating Costs: Energy Dominates

**UK Industrial Electricity Prices (2025-2026):**
| Country | Price (£/MWh) |
|---------|---------------|
| UK | £56 |
| Netherlands | £34-38 |
| Belgium | £34-38 |

**UK Energy Crisis for CEA (April 2026):**
- **94% increase** in electricity network standing charges scheduled
- Large glasshouse businesses face **~£1 million additional annual costs**
- Charges based on **grid pull capacity**, not actual usage—devastating for high-capacity vertical farms
- Sector **excluded from Energy Intensive Industries (EII) exemption** due to outdated SIC codes

**Fischer Farms Energy Evolution:**
- Original business model designed for **10 pence/kWh**
- Current UK electricity: **~22 pence/kWh**
- At 10p: rocket (arugula) profitable
- At 22p: rocket **not profitable**
- Response: Redesigned entire lighting system
  - **60% less electricity** than first-gen fixtures
  - **90% cost reduction** in lighting hardware
  - Stripped aluminum extrusions, simplified to essential diodes

### Energy Per Kilogram of Produce

**Estimated energy consumption (compiled from industry data):**
| Crop | kWh/kg | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Leafy greens (lettuce) | 20-35 kWh/kg | Highly variable by system efficiency |
| Herbs (basil) | 25-40 kWh/kg | Higher light requirements |
| Microgreens | 10-20 kWh/kg | Short growth cycle = less cumulative energy |
| Strawberries | 30-50 kWh/kg | Long cycle, high light needs |

**At £0.22/kWh UK prices:**
- Lettuce: **£4.40-7.70/kg** in electricity alone
- Microgreens: **£2.20-4.40/kg** in electricity alone

**Comparison:** Field-grown lettuce wholesale: £0.50-1.00/kg

### Labor Requirements

**Industry estimates:**
- Traditional vertical farms: **0.5-2.0 labor hours per kg** of produce
- Highly automated systems (AeroFarms, Plenty): Target **<0.3 labor hours per kg**
- Field agriculture: **0.01-0.05 labor hours per kg** for mechanized crops

**Labor is the second-largest cost** after energy, typically **20-30% of operating expenses**

**Automation trends (2025-2026):**
- South Korea's Rowain: Robotic vertical farming with AMRs (Autonomous Mobile Robots) separating cultivation from workspace
- Fischer Farms: Trolley-based modular systems allowing human-height access for maintenance
- Oishii (strawberries): Heavy automation enabling premium pricing ($12.99 for 8 strawberries)

## What Crops Work (And Don't)

### ✅ PROFITABLE CROPS

**1. Microgreens** (Best economics)
- Growth cycle: 7-14 days
- Price premium: 5x-40x mature equivalents
- AeroFarms dominates with 70%+ US market share
- Lower cumulative energy due to short cycle

**2. Herbs** (Good economics)
- Basil, cilantro, mint, dill
- High retail value per kg
- Consumer willingness to pay for freshness
- Year-round consistency valuable to restaurants

**3. Leafy Greens - Premium Segment**
- Baby lettuce, arugula (rocket), specialty lettuces
- ONLY profitable in markets with:
  - High import costs (remote locations)
  - Premium retail channels
  - Low energy costs (<$0.10/kWh)

**4. Premium Strawberries** (Emerging)
- Oishii: $12.99 for 8 strawberries in Ontario retail
- Plenty: 1.8 million kg/year facility
- Requires Japanese-style quality positioning
- Factor of 30x yield improvement over field (year-round production)

**5. Propagation/Seedlings** (B2B opportunity)
- Fischer Farms pivoting here
- Tomato, cucumber, pepper seedlings for greenhouse growers
- Tree propagation
- Eliminates timing mismatches in transplant supply

### ❌ NON-VIABLE CROPS

**1. Commodity Lettuce**
- Cannot compete with field prices
- Bowery's core product—contributed to their failure
- Only viable in extreme locations (Arctic, space)

**2. Root Vegetables**
- Potatoes, carrots, beets
- Space requirements prohibitive
- No premium positioning possible

**3. Grains**
- Wheat, rice, corn
- Absolutely impossible economics
- Energy cost per calorie is 100x+ field farming

**4. Tree Fruits**
- Apples, citrus
- Physical space requirements
- Multi-year production cycles

**5. Most Staple Crops**
- Vertical farming cannot and will not replace field agriculture for calories

## Singapore: The Test Case

Singapore represents the optimal conditions for vertical farming: limited land, high imports, government support, and food security concerns.

### Government Policy
- **"30 by 30" goal** (2019): Produce 30% of nutritional needs locally by 2030
- **Revised targets** (November 2025): 
  - 20% of fibre (leafy vegetables) by 2035
  - 30% of protein (seafood, eggs) by 2035
- Current local production: 8% fibre, 26% protein (2024)

### Funding & Programs
- **30x30 Express:** S$30 million competitive grants (2020)
- **ACT Fund:** S$60 million for tech adoption (2021)
- **Singapore Food Story R&D:** S$144 million for agri-tech R&D

### Results: Disappointing
Despite massive government investment, **vegetable production has DECLINED:**

| Year | Vegetables (tonnes) | Seafood (tonnes) | Eggs (million) |
|------|---------------------|------------------|----------------|
| 2019 | 24,296 | 5,335 | 528 |
| 2024 | 16,391 | 3,533 | 773 |
| Change | **-33%** | **-34%** | **+46%** |

**Only egg production increased.** Vertical farming vegetables failed to scale even with ideal policy conditions.

### Notable Singapore Operators
- Sky Greens: Pioneering rotating vertical system (low-energy, uses natural light)
- Various high-tech indoor farms receiving government grants
- None have achieved meaningful market share

**Lesson:** Even with perfect policy alignment, vertical farming vegetables cannot compete with imports at scale.

## Industry Consolidation & New Models

### The Fischer Farms Pivot
Most significant strategic shift in the industry:

**Old model:** Grow premium greens, sell to supermarkets, compete on brand
**New model:** "We want to be an equipment manufacturer for people who are farmers"

Key quotes from CEO Tristan Fischer:
- "Our obsession is how to make the system cheaper, cheaper, cheaper"
- "If it is cheap, people can afford it. If it is too expensive, the market is restricted"
- "Vertical farming is a better product than field-grown... But if it stays a luxury item, the market will always be small"

Fischer draws parallels to renewable energy cost curves:
- Wind and solar saw 80-90% cost drops over 20-25 years
- Vertical farming is in "1890s automobile" phase
- Need "Model T moment" focused on affordability

### AeroFarms Post-Bankruptcy Model
- Focus on **microgreens only** (highest margins)
- Commercialize technology for licensing
- Maintain 70%+ market share in niche
- Partnership with Costco proves mainstream viability

### Who's Left Standing (Major Players, 2026)
1. **AeroFarms** - Microgreens specialist, technology licensor
2. **Plenty** - Strawberries, AI-focused
3. **Fischer Farms** - Equipment manufacturing pivot
4. **80 Acres Farms** - Merged with Soil Organics (Aug 2025), 7 US facilities, ~20M lbs/year
5. **Oishii** - Ultra-premium Japanese strawberries
6. **AppHarvest, Gotham Greens** - Hybrid greenhouse models (not pure vertical)

---

## Niche Applications: Where VF Actually Works

### 1. Extreme Locations
- **Alert, Nunavut, Canada:** Northernmost vertical farm (817 km from North Pole)
  - -36°C, 24-hour darkness in winter
  - Container farm producing lettuce, herbs
  - Weeks without supply flights
  - Economics work because alternative is $20+ lettuce
- **Military bases, offshore platforms, space stations**

### 2. Food Deserts / Urban Cores
- Harlem shipping container farms
- University campus farms (Hofstra, NY)
- Locations where "local" has marketing value

### 3. High-Value Medicinal/Specialty Crops
- Saffron (aeroponically grown)
- Pharmaceutical compounds (DARPA 18-story facility for vaccine proteins)
- Cannabis (where legal)

### 4. B2B Propagation
- Seedlings for greenhouse operations
- Eliminates timing mismatches
- Disease-free starting material
- Tree nurseries (emerging market)

### 5. Microgreens (Proven Economics)
- Restaurant/foodservice supply
- Premium retail
- Short cycle = manageable energy costs

## Conclusions

### What the Data Shows

1. **Energy costs determine viability.** At >$0.15/kWh, only premium crops work. At >$0.20/kWh, only microgreens and ultra-premium products survive.

2. **Capital is not the bottleneck.** Hundreds of millions flowed to Bowery and AeroFarms. They still failed or needed restructuring. Unit economics, not funding, kills companies.

3. **Government support is necessary but not sufficient.** Singapore invested S$200M+ and vegetable production still declined 33%.

4. **The pivot is to niche, not scale.** Survivors are becoming equipment suppliers, microgreen specialists, or ultra-premium producers—not commodity vegetable growers.

5. **Automation is critical but not a silver bullet.** Reducing labor from 30% to 15% of costs doesn't fix the energy problem.

6. **Geographic arbitrage matters.** Netherlands (€34/MWh) vs UK (€56/MWh) = 65% higher energy costs = completely different business viability.

### The Real Opportunity

Vertical farming's future is **not** feeding cities with commodity vegetables. It's:

- **Technology licensing** (Fischer Farms model)
- **Premium niches** (microgreens, Japanese strawberries)
- **Extreme locations** (Arctic, military, offshore)
- **Propagation services** (B2B seedlings)
- **Integrated systems** (waste-to-energy + farming)

The industry will consolidate further. Expect 2-3 more high-profile failures in 2026-2027. The survivors will be specialists, not generalists.
