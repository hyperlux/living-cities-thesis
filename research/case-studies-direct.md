## Detroit Urban Farming — WORKING MODEL

**Beaverland Farms (Brightmoor)**
- 4-acre production farm in Brightmoor neighborhood
- Broadening customer base through sustainable practices (May 2025)
- Part of city's official Neighborhood Framework Plan

**Infrastructure:**
- Urban Agriculture Division established 2023
- $240K in grants shared by 9 farmers/collectives
- Detroit Black Farmer Land Fund for BIPOC land ownership
- Brightmoor Farmstead Incubator Project establishing land trust

**Key Stat:** 60% of Brightmoor is vacant land (~15,000 acres potential)

**Model:** Community-organized + vacancy-based + cooperative ownership

**Lesson for Living Cities:** Post-industrial cities have land. What they need is organization, funding, and cooperative structures.

## Medellín Social Urbanism — SUCCESS WITH CAVEATS

**Transformation:**
- From "most dangerous city in world" to globally celebrated example
- Cable cars (MetroCable) connecting marginal hillside communities
- Social Urbanism as planning paradigm
- Green corridors cooling streets

**Results:**
- Improved inclusion
- Cut poverty
- Slashed trip times
- Quality of life improvements documented (Bogotá TransMiCable study 2025)

**Caveats (Feb 2026 analysis):**
- Inequality persists beneath success narrative
- Gentrification accelerating
- Tourism-driven displacement rising
- "Can its transformation truly be a model for the Global South?" — Sinfiltroya

**Lesson for Living Cities:** Infrastructure can transform but doesn't automatically solve inequality. Need anti-displacement mechanisms from start.

## CLT Growth (from earlier research)

- 308 CLTs in 48 US states + DC + Puerto Rico (Jan 2024)
- Up from 289 (2021), 225 (2018), 162 (2006)
- NYC CLT movement rising with new policy tools
- Hawaii adapting for plantation-era housing preservation
- London expanding cooperative housing + CLTs

## Participatory Budgeting Growth

- Barcelona: 30 million euros over 4 years (2024-2027)
- Decidim platform: 489 instances, 32 countries, 925K+ participants
- Over 100 US cities implementing
- Finland experiment: improved life satisfaction, reduced mental health problems

## Citizen Assemblies — EVIDENCE OF SUCCESS

**Ireland:**
- Recommended legalizing abortion AND same-sex marriage
- Parliament followed recommendations
- Constitutional change through deliberation
- Model now being emulated worldwide

**France Citizens' Convention for Climate:**
- Compared to Irish model in academic literature
- 150 citizens, randomly selected
- 149 proposals produced

**Netherlands (2025):**
- Citizens' Assembly met over 7 weekends
- Government required to respond within 6 months
- Binding deliberative process

**Key finding:** Success requires social movement support + government commitment to respond.

## Key Patterns Across Cases

1. **Working models exist** — Detroit farming, Medellín transport, Vienna housing, Barcelona superblocks

2. **Success ≠ solving inequality** — Medellín improved but displacement continues; need explicit anti-displacement design

3. **Cooperative ownership matters** — Detroit moving toward land trusts; CLTs prevent speculation

4. **Citizen assemblies work when binding** — Ireland > France because parliament actually acted

5. **Scale is neighborhood-first** — Beaverland is 4 acres, not 4,000; Brightmoor is one neighborhood

6. **Vacancy is opportunity** — Detroit's 60% vacant land, post-industrial sites globally
