- **Motional**: Partners with Uber/Lyft
- **Tesla**: Consumer vehicle autonomy expansion

**Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAV) Trajectory:**
- PwC research: SAV models emerging
- 24/7 robotaxi services operational in Bay Area
- Federal rules in 2025 aimed at simplifying reporting

**Implications for Living Cities:**
- Car ownership becomes optional
- Parking space → productive space
- Last-mile logistics solved
- Reduced road width requirements possible

## Synthesis: Infrastructure for Permanence

**AV + CLT = Car-free, speculation-free neighborhoods**

1. **Autonomous mobility** removes need for personal parking
   - ~30% of urban land currently parking
   - Can be converted to: housing, food production, green space

2. **Community land trusts** remove speculation
   - Land held permanently for community
   - Housing affordable in perpetuity
   - Democratic governance built-in

**Living City Application:**
- Mobility organ: Shared AV fleet, no private cars within
- Housing organ: CLT structure, no speculation
- Land recovery: Parking → productive use

**Data Point:** If 30% parking land + CLT anti-speculation = potentially double housing density at lower cost with more green space.
