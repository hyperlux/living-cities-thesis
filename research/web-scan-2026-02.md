## 1. Network State Projects (2025-2026)

### 1.1 Praxis — "The World's First Digital Nation"

**Status:** Active, scaling community  
**Website:** praxisnation.com (redirected from praxissociety.com)

**Current State (Feb 2026):**
- Claims 151,068 "Praxians" across 401 cities in 82 countries
- Praxian-founded companies valued at over $1 trillion (self-reported)
- Pivoted messaging to "Reunite the West" — explicitly cultural-civilizational framing
- Primary focus: building "Acceleration Zones" — special economic zones designed for tech acceleration

**Key Developments:**
- **Digital Nation Model:** Internet-native organization with shared culture/worldview, internal economy, and governing institutions
- **Acceleration Zones:** New SEZ concept targeting AI (power/data centers), crypto regulation, energy (nuclear fission/fusion licensing), and biotech (streamlined regulation)
- **Citizenship path:** Citizens take a pledge, engage via Discord, and crowdfund physical city development
- **Philosophy:** Explicitly civilizational — "restore Western Civilization and pursue our ultimate destiny of life among the stars"

**Assessment:**
- ✅ **Working:** Community building at scale, strong narrative cohesion, wealth concentration among members
- ⚠️ **Challenges:** No physical territory secured yet; primarily online community; ideological narrowness may limit broad appeal
- ❌ **Risks:** Heavy reliance on crypto wealth; "digital nation" remains legally undefined; potential cult-like dynamics

- Honduras Próspera Inc. suing Honduras for **$10.7 billion** in damages (one-third of Honduras's GDP)
- Honduras withdrew from ICSID (World Bank arbitration) in August 2024
- **Despite legal battles, Próspera continues operating**

**Key Developments (2025-2026):**
- **January 2025:** Coinbase Ventures announced investment "to grow financial inclusion and innovation"
- **Construction ongoing:** "The Circular Factory" — robots converting wooden blocks into building materials
- **Events hosted:** Biotech startup events ($1.5M VC raised), "crypto cities summit" (Feb 2025)
- **Tax structure:** 1% business revenue, 5% wages, 2.5% sales tax, 5% personal income
- **Bitcoin:** Recognized as legal tender within the ZEDE

**Governance Model:**
- 9-member council (5 elected, 4 appointed by Honduras Próspera Inc.)
- Two-thirds majority required = developer veto power
- Visitors sign "temporary touristic access permit" at armed gates
- Own civil/commercial codes; can import regulations from approved foreign jurisdictions

**Local Tensions:**
- Crawfish Rock villagers fear land expropriation
- Unpaved roads, groundwater/sewage disputes
- Próspera uses Roatán's infrastructure (garbage dump, electricity, airports) with inequities

**Critical Voices:**
- **Paul Romer** (Nobel laureate who originated charter city concept): "Living in this libertarian fantasy that they can be free of the government. That's not gonna turn out well."
- Próspera founder Erick Brimen lobbied US Congress for sanctions on Honduras
- US Rep. Steven Horsford pressured Honduras (received $5K Brimen donation)

**Assessment:**
- ✅ **Working:** Functional buildings, active crypto/biotech community, regulatory arbitrage attracts businesses
- ⚠️ **Challenges:** Existential legal threat; reputational damage from aggressive lobbying; local community antagonism
- ❌ **Failed:** Community integration; democratic legitimacy; "prosperity" trickling to locals

## 2. AI Agent Governance Experiments

### 2.1 Collective Constitutional AI (Anthropic + Collective Intelligence Project)

**Landmark experiment completed 2023-2024**

**Methodology:**
- ~1,000 Americans participated via Polis platform
- Public drafted AI constitution through deliberation
- 1,127 statements contributed, 38,252 votes cast
- High consensus found on most statements

**Key Findings:**
- ~50% overlap between public and Anthropic-written constitutions
- Public constitution was MORE focused on:
  - Objectivity and impartiality
  - Accessibility (especially for disabilities)
  - Promoting positive behavior (vs. avoiding negative)
  - Self-generated principles (not copied from existing documents)

**Model Training Results:**
- Public-constitution model performed equivalently on language/math tasks
- Rated equally helpful and harmless by users
- **Lower bias** across 9 social dimensions (especially disability status, physical appearance)
- Similar political ideology representation (slightly liberal-leaning for both)

**Implications:**
- Demonstrates feasibility of democratic AI alignment
- Public preferences differ meaningfully from developer assumptions
- Deliberation can produce coherent, trainable constitutional principles

## 5. Cross-Cutting Themes & Analysis

### 5.1 What's Working

| Project | Key Success Factor |
|---------|-------------------|
| Culdesac Tempe | Proof of concept for car-free US development |
| Gelephu Mindfulness City | Sovereign backing + unique philosophy |
| Collective Constitutional AI | Demonstrated democratic AI alignment feasibility |
| Decidim | Open-source platform scaled globally |
| CLTs | Proven 40+ year model for permanent affordability |

### 5.2 What's Failing or Struggling

| Project | Primary Failure Mode |
|---------|---------------------|
| Próspera | Democratic legitimacy crisis; local antagonism |
| Praxis | Still no physical territory; ideological narrowness |
| Telosa | Years of promises, no construction |
| Porto Alegre PB | Political sustainability; eventually suspended |

### 5.3 Emerging Tensions

1. **Sovereignty vs. Democracy:** Network states often prioritize exit over voice; charter cities grant developer veto power
2. **Crypto Dependency:** Multiple projects rely on volatile digital assets for funding
3. **Scale vs. Participation:** Larger PB/governance systems struggle to maintain deliberative quality
4. **Cultural Framing:** Projects like Praxis use civilizational/Western restoration framing that may limit appeal
5. **Legal Uncertainty:** Network states operate in legal grey zones; Próspera case may set precedents

### 5.4 Key Innovations to Watch

1. **Bhutan's GNH-integrated development model** — Alternative to libertarian charter city paradigm
2. **Constitutional AI via public deliberation** — Scalable democratic AI alignment
3. **Commercial CLTs** — Extending affordability model beyond housing
4. **Decidim ecosystem** — Open-source democratic infrastructure
5. **Hybrid digital/physical governance** — Praxis's "digital nation" concept evolution

---

## 6. Research Gaps & Questions

1. How do long-term outcomes differ between top-down (legally mandated) vs. bottom-up (locally initiated) PB?
2. What governance structures enable network states to maintain legitimacy without nation-state recognition?
3. Can CLT models scale to neighborhood/city-wide land ownership?
4. How can AI governance experiments move from advisory to binding?
5. What role should indigenous/traditional governance models play in network state design?
