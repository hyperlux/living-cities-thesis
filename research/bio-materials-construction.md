## Executive Summary

Bio-based construction materials are transitioning from laboratory curiosities to commercial realities. Mycelium composites, bacterial cellulose, bio-concrete, and living building materials represent a spectrum of technological readiness—from acoustic panels already in buildings to self-regenerating structures still in research. This document maps the current state of commercialization, identifies what has scaled beyond the lab, and compares costs against conventional materials.
