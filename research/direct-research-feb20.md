## India Smart Cities Mission — FAILURE CASE STUDY

**Status (2025-2026):**
- Only 18 out of 100 cities completed projects after a decade
- Multiple deadline extensions (original 2020 → June 2024 → March 2025)
- Budget 2026 pivots away from "Smart Cities" to "City Economic Regions"
- Wire calls it "unceremonious end"

**Failure Patterns:**
- Top-down approach sidelining local governments
- Technology-intensive projects failed to create promised impact
- Corruption and mismanagement widespread
- Thiruvananthapuram: multi-day water shortages in 2025 due to neglected infrastructure
- Focus on ICT solutions over basic services

**Lesson for Living Cities:** 
Technology is not the answer. Basic services + community engagement > sensors + apps.

## 15-Minute City — IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS

**Paris:**
- Mayor Anne Hidalgo making it "backbone of urban plan"
- 94% already live within 5 min of bakery (baseline advantage)
- Expanded bike lanes + pedestrian zones
- Net zero by 2050 target with 15-min city at heart

**Barcelona Superblocks — HARD DATA:**
- Sant Antoni superblock (since 2018):
  - **NO2 down 25-33%**
  - **PM10 down 17%**
  - **Car traffic down 82%**
  - **Noise down 4.1 dB daytime**
- Poblenou (first superblock, 5 years):
  - **20 more local businesses opened**
  - **Commercial activity up 30%**
- Heat island effect reduced
- Green space +1 m² per capita

**Melbourne:** Incorporating framework for future-proofing services

**Key insight:** Superblocks work AND improve local economy. Not a tradeoff.

## Vienna Social Housing — SUCCESS MODEL

**Current Status:**
- 60% of Vienna residents live in subsidized housing
- Rents 3x cheaper than London per sqm
- Lowest rent of any major Western European city
- May 2025: Access rules eased (no longer need 2 years at same address)
- Target: 5,500 new Gemeindebau apartments by 2025

**Success Factors:**
- Continuous political support since 1920s
- Network of supportive institutions (unions, tenant associations, Chamber of Labor)
- Mixed-income approach prevents ghettoization
- Quality emphasis — not just "affordable" but desirable

**Critiques:** AEI paper questions some claims but acknowledges broad success

**Lesson for Living Cities:** Political coalition + institutional network = durability

## Singapore 30 by 30 — REALITY CHECK

**Original Goal:** 30% of nutritional needs produced locally by 2030

**Current Status (late 2025):**
- **Goal DROPPED** — replaced with protein/fiber targets for 2035
- Several vertical farm failures:
  - I.F.F.I shut down
  - VertiVegies abandoned mega-farm plans
- World's tallest indoor vertical farm opened ($80M) but sector struggling

**Why Failing:**
- Less than 1% of land used for agriculture
- Vertical farming economics still challenging
- Global supply chains often cheaper

**What's Working:**
- SFA investing in agrifood research
- Multi-tenanted production facility being studied
- Sky Greens still operating

**Lesson for Living Cities:** 
Don't overpromise on urban food production. 30% is extremely ambitious. Focus on resilience (backup capacity) not autarky. Regional foodsheds more realistic than full local production.

## Key Takeaways for Thesis

1. **Smart City ≠ Living City** — India's failure proves technology-first approaches don't work

2. **Superblocks WORK** — Barcelona has hard data: pollution down, business up, quality of life improved

3. **Social housing requires political infrastructure** — Vienna's 100-year success built on coalition

4. **Urban food production is harder than projected** — Singapore's retreat is warning

5. **15-minute city is mainstream** — Paris, Melbourne, Barcelona all implementing versions

6. **Measure outcomes, not inputs** — Barcelona measures air quality, not smart sensors installed
