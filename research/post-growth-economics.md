# Post-Growth Economics and Degrowth Cities: Deep Research 2025-2026

## Executive Summary

This research documents the practical implementation of post-growth and wellbeing economic frameworks across cities and nations. Unlike theoretical discussions of degrowth, this focuses on **what is actually being measured and implemented** as of 2025-2026. The movement has reached a critical inflection point: over 50 local governments globally now work with Doughnut Economics, wellbeing budgets are operational (though politically contested) in multiple nations, and alternative metrics frameworks are being institutionalized.

## 1. AMSTERDAM: THE POST-GROWTH PIONEER

### Historical Context
- **April 2020**: First city globally to adopt Doughnut Economics as official policy framework
- Emerged during COVID-19 pandemic recovery planning
- Led by Deputy Mayor Marieke van Doorninck (Sustainability)

### Implementation Structure

#### Key Policy Documents
1. **Amsterdam City Portrait (2020)** - First Doughnut City Portrait methodology
2. **Amsterdam Circular Strategy 2020-2025** - Halve raw material use by 2030, fully circular by 2050
3. **Implementation Agenda 2023-2026** - 70+ concrete actions
4. **Comprehensive Vision Amsterdam 2050: A Humane Metropolis** - Long-term spatial planning
5. **Amsterdam Makes Space** (Mobility Vision) - Triple boundary framework

#### What's Actually Being Measured

**Circular Economy Monitor** (bi-annual)
- Environmental impact of material use
- "Impact elsewhere" - consumption footprint beyond city limits
- Social impact metrics linked to material flows

**"Beyond GDP" Indicators** - Published bi-annually by Research & Statistics Department:
- Housing affordability (20% of tenants cannot meet basic needs after rent)
- Social housing access (only 12% of 60,000 applicants successful)
- Carbon emissions (31% above 1990 levels as of 2020)
- Import emissions (62% of total emissions from imported materials, food, consumer goods)

### Hard Data Points
- Population: 918,000
- CO2 emissions 31% above 1990 baseline
- 62% of emissions "embodied" in imports
- Focus sectors: consumer goods, built environment, food/organic waste
- Working on new subsidy programme for Doughnut-contributing initiatives
- Developing decision-making tool for Doughnut-aligned policymaking

### Governance Innovation
- **Amsterdam Doughnut Coalition** - Civil society self-organizing network
- **District-level projects** - "Donut Bakery" and similar neighborhood initiatives
- Cross-departmental integration (Sustainability + Spatial Planning + Mobility teams)

### Current Status (2025-2026)
- Work now led by Circular Team within Sustainability Department
- Support from full municipal executive leadership (expanded from initial single Deputy Mayor)
- Main acknowledged challenge: connecting social and climate aspects internally

## 2. BARCELONA: DEGROWTH CITY IN PRACTICE

### Context and Timeline
- **2020**: Climate Emergency Declaration
- **2021**: Engagement with Doughnut Economics begins
- **2022**: Commitment to develop Barcelona City Portrait
- **2024**: Citizens Commitment for a More Sustainable Barcelona 2024-2034 launched

### Barcelona City Portrait: Four Lenses Data

#### LOCAL SOCIAL LENS - "How can the people of Barcelona thrive?"

**Indicators meeting targets:**
- Education
- Political voice
- Peace & justice
- Employment (6.6% unemployment vs 8.3% target in 2020)

**Indicators requiring attention:**
- Social and gender equality
- Access to energy
- Health (mental health deteriorating)
- Mobility: Traffic accident deaths score 0.55 (very poor)

#### LOCAL ECOLOGICAL LENS - "How can Barcelona be as generous as surrounding nature?"

**All indicators exceed "safe and just space":**
- Energy capture/use: **7x above sustainable limit**
- Air quality (NO2, PM2.5, PM10): **4x WHO safe limits**
- Food consumption/production: **3x above sustainable threshold**

#### GLOBAL SOCIAL LENS - "How can Barcelona respect wellbeing of all people?"

**Critical finding:** 96.7% of resources consumed in Barcelona come from countries in more precarious situations than Spain.

**Resource dependencies (90% from 12 countries):**
- Minerals: Primarily China
- Metals: "Rest of America"
- Biomass, fossil fuels, soils: "Rest of Africa"
- Land footprint: 11,207 km² (100x Barcelona's surface area)

**Key insight:** Barcelona improves its local social foundation at the expense of others globally - classic consumption externalization.

#### GLOBAL ECOLOGICAL LENS - "How can Barcelona respect planetary health?"

**6 of 7 calculated planetary boundaries breached:**
- Phosphorus applied to crops: **7x per capita limit**
- Material footprint: **5x established limit**
- CO2 emissions: Need **400% reduction** for Paris Agreement 1.5°C target
- Remaining biophysical indicators: 1.5-3x safe thresholds

**One positive:** Blue Water Extraction currently within sustainable levels (but only 14% margin before overshoot)

### Implementation Partners
- Barcelona Regional (public planning agency)
- Universitat de Barcelona
- Barcelona + Sustainable Network (2,000+ organizations)
- Municipal Council for Environment and Sustainability

### Key Outcomes
1. Barcelona City Dònut (full portrait)
2. Citizens Commitment for a More Sustainable Barcelona 2024-2034
3. City Collaborative Challenges framework
4. Technical support secretariat established

### Challenges Identified
- Indicator selection methodology needs strengthening
- Concept closely linked to degrowth - "not yet on agenda in some circles"
- Low public awareness leading to poor participation turnout
- Differences between expert and citizen opinions in workshops

---

## 3. BHUTAN: GROSS NATIONAL HAPPINESS (GNH) MODEL

### Constitutional Basis
- GNH instituted in **Constitution of Bhutan (July 18, 2008)**
- Originated with 4th King Jigme Singye Wangchuck, 1972
- Famous declaration: GNH "more important than Gross Domestic Product"

### The Four Pillars
1. Sustainable and equitable socio-economic development
2. Environmental conservation
3. Preservation and promotion of culture
4. Good governance

### The Nine Domains (What's Actually Measured)

| Domain | Key Indicators | Weight |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| Psychological well-being | Life satisfaction, emotional balance, spirituality | Equal domain weight |
| Health | Mental health, self-reported health, disabilities, healthy days | Equal |
| Time use | Work hours, sleeping hours | Equal |
| Education | Literacy, education level, knowledge, values | Equal |
| Cultural diversity and resilience | Artisan skills, cultural participation, language, Driglam Namzha | Equal |
| Good governance | Government performance, fundamental rights, services, political participation | Equal |
| Community vitality | Donations, safety, community relationships, family | Equal |
| Ecological diversity and resilience | Wildlife damage, urban issues, environmental responsibility, ecological issues | Equal |
| Living standards | Assets, housing, household per capita income | Equal |

### Measurement Methodology
- Mix of subjective (survey-based) and objective indicators
- Domains weighted equally; indicators within domains weighted differently
- Classification: "Happy" (deeply/extensively happy) vs "Not-yet-happy" (narrowly happy/unhappy)
- Based on Alkire & Foster method (2011), developed with Oxford University

### Survey History
- **2008**: First GNH survey
- **2010**: Second survey
- **2015**: Third nationwide survey
- Covers all 20 districts (Dzonkhag)
- Results reported by gender, age, location, occupation

### Institutional Implementation
- **GNH Commission**: Chaired by Prime Minister, includes all ministry secretaries
- **GNH Policy Screening Tool**: Evaluates policies before passage
- **GNH Project Screening Tool**: Screens projects before implementation
- Five-year plans guided by GNH Index

### International Impact
- **2011**: UN General Assembly Resolution 65/309 "Happiness: towards a holistic approach to development"
- **2012**: High-Level Meeting on Well-being and Happiness at UN (convened by Bhutan PM and Ban Ki-moon)
- **March 20**: International Day of Happiness (UN Resolution 66/28)
- **December 2023**: Bhutan graduated from Least Developed Country to Developing Country

### Global Adoption of GNH-Inspired Approaches
- Victoria, British Columbia, Canada
- São Paulo State, Brazil
- Seattle, Washington, USA
- Eau Claire, Wisconsin; Creston, BC; Vermont
- Thailand (2016 - own GNH center)
- Philippines (bills filed in Senate and House)

### Critical Context
- **World Happiness Report 2019**: Bhutan ranked 95th of 156 countries
- Historical criticism: ethnic cleansing of ~100,000 Lhotshampa (Nepalese origin) in 1990s
- Current government under PM Tshering Tobgay initially skeptical but now promotes GNH internationally

## 4. KATE RAWORTH & DOUGHNUT ECONOMICS: BEYOND THE MODEL

### Origin and Development
- **2012**: "A Safe and Just Space for Humanity" Oxfam discussion paper
- **2017**: "Doughnut Economics: Seven Ways to Think Like a 21st-Century Economist" published
- Based at Oxford University's Environmental Change Institute

### The Doughnut Framework

**Social Foundation (12 dimensions from UN SDGs):**
1. Food security
2. Health
3. Education
4. Income and work
5. Peace and justice
6. Political voice
7. Social equity
8. Gender equality
9. Housing
10. Networks (social + informational)
11. Energy
12. Water

**Ecological Ceiling (9 planetary boundaries from Rockström/Steffen):**
1. Climate change
2. Ocean acidification
3. Chemical pollution
4. Nitrogen and phosphorus loading
5. Freshwater withdrawals
6. Land conversion
7. Biodiversity loss
8. Air pollution
9. Ozone layer depletion

### Doughnut Economics Action Lab (DEAL)

**Scale of Implementation (2025):**
- **50+ local and regional governments** working with Doughnut Economics
- Cities include: Amsterdam, Barcelona, Riga, Tomelilla (Sweden), California, Geneva, Melbourne, Birmingham, Brussels, London, Glasgow, Copenhagen, Grenoble, Nanaimo (Canada), Bad Nauheim (Germany), Ipoh (Malaysia), Cornwall, Brussels, Lviv (Ukraine), Izmir (Turkey)

**Key Tools Developed:**
1. City Portrait methodology - "Doughnut Data Portraits"
2. Four Lenses framework (Local Social, Local Ecological, Global Social, Global Ecological)
3. Doughnut Unrolled - Re-rolled visualization
4. Step Into The Doughnut (available in 30 languages)
5. Data Portrait Visualiser & Data Hub
6. Indicator Library (thousands of indicators from 30+ portraits)

### Critical Academic Assessment

**Erik Schokkaert (Welfare Economist):**
- Raworth raises important challenges but doesn't address specifics
- Criticism targets a "caricature" of mainstream economics (straw man)
- Policy prescriptions based on "beliefs, hopes, and convictions" rather than empirical analysis

**Branko Milanović (CUNY Stone Center):**
- If everyone reached median rich-country income, world GDP would need to triple
- "Green" initiatives assessed are marginal compared to what's needed
- No convincing arguments for how a "no-growth" regime could emerge
- Relies on "miracles" while ignoring China's growth lifting 700 million from poverty

**Maria Zhivitskaya (LSE):**
- Flowery metaphors provide little guidance for concrete policymaking
- Dismissal of "rational economic man" based on weak reasoning

### Raworth's Position on Growth
- Explicitly states "significant GDP growth is very much needed" for low- and middle-income countries
- The framework is about meeting needs within planetary boundaries, not anti-growth per se
- Distinguishes between countries that need growth and those that need different metrics

## 5. WELLBEING ECONOMY GOVERNMENTS (WEGo)

### Member Nations
1. **Scotland** (founding member, provides Secretariat)
2. **New Zealand** (pioneer, 2019)
3. **Iceland**
4. **Wales**
5. **Finland**
6. **Canada** (actively participating)

Established 2018-2021; operates independently with Scottish Government support.

### WEGo Commitments
1. Collaborate on innovative policy approaches
2. Progress toward UN SDGs (especially Goal 17 - partnerships)
3. Address economic, social, and environmental challenges of our time

### NEW ZEALAND: The Wellbeing Budget Experiment

**Timeline:**
- **May 2019**: First Wellbeing Budget launched under PM Jacinda Ardern
- **2024**: Approach scrapped by National-led coalition government

**The Five Priorities:**
1. Climate and environment
2. Productive work
3. Māori and Pacific opportunities
4. Child wellbeing
5. Mental and physical health

**Ardern's Framework Statement:**
> "The purpose of government spending is to ensure citizens' health and life satisfaction, and that — not wealth or economic growth — is the metric by which a country's progress should be measured. GDP alone does not guarantee improvement to our living standards and does not take into account who benefits and who is left out."

**Living Standards Framework:**
- Developed by New Zealand Treasury
- Measures across multiple wellbeing domains
- Integrated into budgetary decision-making

**Current Status:**
- WEAll Aotearoa NZ continues as "think and do tank"
- Political continuity disrupted by change in government
- Framework institutionally embedded but de-emphasized

### SCOTLAND: National Performance Framework

**Current Status (February 2026):**
- Under comprehensive review
- Draft NPF proposals shared with Parliament Finance and Public Administration Committee (Feb 16, 2026)
- Consultation underway with public, third, and private sectors
- Recommendations being prepared for incoming government following 2026 Scottish Parliament Election

**Framework Goals:**
- Set vision for desired Scotland
- Support public service reform
- Enable national-local government collaboration
- Empower communities

**Historical approach:** National indicators across wellbeing dimensions, moving "beyond GDP"

## 6. STEADY-STATE ECONOMICS: Theoretical Foundations

### Definition (Center for Advancement of Steady State Economy - CASSE)

A steady state economy has:
- Constant populations of people (stable labor stocks)
- Constant stocks of capital
- Constant rate of throughput (energy and materials)

**Key distinction:** Economic development (qualitative change) vs economic growth (quantitative increase)

### Core Principles

1. **Neither growth nor recession is sustainable** - only stability
2. Economic growth = increasing population × per capita consumption
3. Throughput has thermodynamic limits (laws of thermodynamics)
4. Maximum economy size constrained by ecological carrying capacity

### Policy Tools
Same fiscal and monetary tools used for growth:
- Government spending and taxation
- Money supplies and interest rates

**Institutional considerations:**
- Fractional reserve banking may be incompatible
- Fee-service banking proposed as alternative
- Environmental protection policies naturally supportive

### Relationship to Degrowth
- Steady-state is the **end goal**; degrowth is the **transition process** for overgrown economies
- Not anti-development, but post-growth in material throughput
- Qualitative improvement without quantitative expansion

## 7. DEGROWTH: Movement and Implementation

### Historical Timeline

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1972 | André Gorz coins "décroissance" (French); Club of Rome "Limits to Growth" |
| 1970s-80s | Discussions fade with oil crisis resolution and neoliberalism rise |
| 2002 | French magazine "Silence" special issue - 5,000 copies sold, reprinted twice |
| 2002 | Institute for Economic and Social Studies on Sustainable Degrowth founded (Lyon) |
| 2003 | First major symposium with Latouche, Bonaiuti, Ariès, Schneider |
| 2004 | Movement spreads to Italy ("decrescita") |

| 2014 | Leipzig conference |
| 2025+ | Thousands of academic papers, books in major languages |

### Core Principles (Per degrowth.info)

1. **Escaping the growth paradigm** - Growth cannot be decoupled from resource use
2. **Sufficiency** - Equal and fair share of resources for basic needs
3. **Care** - Solidarity over competition; value reproductive/care work
4. **Justice and Distribution** - Fair treatment within/across generations and geographies
5. **Autonomy and Democracy** - Collective self-determination free from domination
6. **Decommodification and Commoning** - Life beyond market logic
7. **Convivial technology** - Accessible, ecological, shared, repairable tools
8. **Rejection of all systems of domination** - Against capitalism, colonialism, patriarchy, extractivism
9. **Combining praxis and theory** - Multi-disciplinary, connecting activists and academics
10. **A world where many worlds fit** - Pluriverse approach, multiple movements

### Why "Degrowth" as Term
- Intentionally provocative and clear
- Hard to co-opt (unlike "sustainable", "green", "eco")
- Creates disruption and catalyzes debate
- Clear opposition to capitalist growth system

## 8. WELLBEING ECONOMY ALLIANCE (WEAll)

### Overview
- Founded 2018 as time-bound project
- Goal: Catalyze transition to Wellbeing Economy by 2040
- Strategy: Radical connection/collaboration between new economy actors

### Vision
> "A world where everyone has enough to live in comfort, safety, and happiness. Where all people feel secure in their basic comforts and can use their creative energies to support the flourishing of all life on this planet."

### Theory of Change
1. Nothing changes without a demanding, demonstrating movement
2. Movements need compelling stories people want to join
3. Ideas improve through sharing, listening, learning
4. Change happens through multiple approaches chipping at different system points
5. Need a "mosaic movement" with diverse skills and spheres of influence

### Three Strategic Fronts
1. **Strengthen geographic/thematic power bases** at all societal levels
2. **Co-create knowledge** demonstrating Wellbeing Economy viability
3. **Change cultural narratives** about what's possible and desirable

### Milestones and Targets

| Year | Public Opinion | Global Governance | National Economies | Global Movements | Organizations | WEAll Hubs |
|------|---------------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------|------------|
| 2025 | WE discussed as viable by int'l orgs, media, influencers | Increasing thought leadership; some beyond-GDP measures adopted | 10 key economies committed; 5 using multidimensional frameworks | Partnership with relevant global movement | Hundreds committed globally | 10 key economies |
| 2030 | Critical mass understands economy as problem driver | Serious reform discussed; majority of institutions use beyond-GDP | 20 committed; 10 redesigned toward Needs Tests | 3+ partnerships | Thousands committed | 25 key economies |
| 2040 | Critical mass feels empowered to change economy | Major changes implemented; definition of "development" shifted | 50 committed; 20 meeting most Needs Tests | Major movements connected | Global cross-sector collaboration | 100 key economies |
| 2050 | Economy viewed as solely serving people and planet | Architecture supports multilateral collaboration | Majority committed and meeting Needs Tests | Working in solidarity | All-level institutions ensure wellbeing | Locally rooted everywhere |

### Notable Ambassadors

**Established (2-5 years):**
- Brussels, Copenhagen, Glasgow, Cornwall, Grenoble, Tomelilla

**Emerging (1-2 years):**
- 40+ additional cities exploring/implementing

### Common Measurement Domains

All frameworks share overlapping dimensions:
1. Health/wellbeing (physical, mental)
2. Education/skills
3. Environmental quality (local)
4. Climate impact (global)
5. Social connections/community
6. Housing
7. Income/work
8. Political voice/governance
9. Cultural factors (varies by context)

## 11. CRITICAL ASSESSMENT: What's Working, What's Not

### Successes

1. **Conceptual shift achieved**: Doughnut/wellbeing language now mainstream in policy discussions
2. **Visualization power**: The doughnut image communicates complex ideas accessibly
3. **Civil society activation**: Amsterdam Doughnut Coalition model replicated elsewhere
4. **Integration into planning**: Embedded in spatial, mobility, and circular economy strategies
5. **50+ government implementations**: Critical mass for learning and iteration

### Challenges

1. **Political vulnerability**: New Zealand shows wellbeing budgets can be reversed with government change
2. **Measurement complexity**: Barcelona noted methodology needs strengthening
3. **Degrowth stigma**: Concept "not yet on agenda in some circles"
4. **Implementation gap**: Frameworks often remain conceptual rather than binding
5. **Global-local disconnect**: Hard to operationalize responsibility for "impact elsewhere"
6. **Departmental silos**: Cross-cutting nature requires collaboration that's hard to achieve

### Key Tensions

1. **Growth vs post-growth**: Even Raworth acknowledges developing countries need GDP growth
2. **Local prosperity vs global responsibility**: Barcelona's portrait reveals consumption externalization
3. **Citizen engagement vs expert methodology**: Differences in priorities between groups
4. **Radical critique vs mainstream acceptance**: How much to challenge vs work within systems

---

## 12. CONCLUSION: State of the Movement 2025-2026

### Key Findings

1. **Post-growth economics has moved from theory to practice** with 50+ cities implementing Doughnut Economics and multiple nations in WEGo partnership.

2. **Hard metrics are being developed** including circular economy monitors, footprint analyses, multi-dimensional wellbeing indicators, and global responsibility accounting.

3. **The movement is politically contested** - New Zealand's reversal shows gains can be rolled back; Scotland's NPF is under review pending elections.

4. **Barcelona's four-lens analysis reveals the core challenge**: Northern cities improve local social foundations while externalizing ecological and social costs globally.

5. **Bhutan remains the longest-running alternative** but faces criticism for both measurement limitations and human rights record.

6. **Critical mass may be approaching** - 68% of G20 populations support prioritizing wellbeing over profit (Earth4All/Ipsos survey).

### What to Watch

- Scotland's 2026 NPF revision and election outcomes
- Amsterdam's new decision-making tool development
- Spread of "re-rolled" four-lens methodology from Barcelona
- Whether post-growth frameworks survive political transitions
- Integration with Just Transition and climate adaptation agendas
