## Commons-Based Peer Production (CBPP) 2025

**Definition (Benkler):**
- "Socio-economic production with large numbers working cooperatively"
- Usually over internet
- Less rigid hierarchical structures
- Beyond traditional business models

**2025 Status (Subcore Oct 2025):**
- "Significant shift" in technological landscape
- "Changing how communities collaborate and innovate"
- Like open-source movement for software

**New Production Institute:**
- CBPP supporting open fabrication
- Open source hardware laboratories (open labs)
- Education, qualification, innovation incubators
- Cooperation with universities, research, companies, communities

**Open Hardware:**
- Different logics identified
- Community-level production
- Multiple geographies documented (Cogitatio Press 2025)

**AI as Commons:**
- "Community-controlled Artificial Intelligence"
- Open-source tools
- Commons-based licensing

**Noosphere Connection (Econology Oct 2025):**
- "Open Sourcing the Noosphere"

## Synthesis: Production + Simulation + Collaboration for Living Cities

| System | Traditional | Living City |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Energy | Consumer only | Prosumer (produce + consume) |
| Planning | Expert design | Digital twin simulation |
| Production | Corporate | Commons-based peer production |
| Knowledge | Proprietary | Open source |

**Living City Design:**

1. **Prosumer Energy:**
   - Every building produces energy
   - Community battery storage
   - EVs as grid resource
   - Net positive energy target

2. **Digital Twin:**
   - Real-time city model
   - Citizen access to simulation
   - Test policy changes before implementation
   - Open data for all

3. **Commons-Based Production:**
   - Open labs in every neighborhood
   - Open source designs for local production
   - Knowledge freely shared
   - Collaborative innovation

**Metric:**
- Energy prosumer ratio (produce/consume)
- Digital twin coverage (% of systems modeled)
- % of production using open source designs
