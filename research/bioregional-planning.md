# Bioregional Planning 2025: Deep Dive Research

## Overview

Bioregional planning represents a fundamental reimagining of governance and land management, organizing political, cultural, and economic systems around naturally defined areas (bioregions) rather than arbitrary political boundaries. This approach emphasizes watersheds, ecosystems, and the cultural patterns that emerge from place-based living.

## 1. Cascadia Bioregion Governance

### Geographic Scope & Ecosystem Data

**Core Territory:**
- Encompasses watersheds of the **Columbia River**, **Fraser River**, **Snake River**, and **Klamath River**
- Extends 2,500+ miles (4,000 km) from Copper River (Alaska) to Cape Mendocino (CA)
- Eastern boundary reaches to Yellowstone Caldera and Continental Divide
- Contains **75 distinct ecoregions**

**Jurisdictional Overlap:**
- All of Washington State
- Most of Idaho (excluding southeastern corner)
- Portions of Oregon, California, Nevada, Utah, Wyoming, Montana, Alaska, Yukon, and British Columbia
- Seven political jurisdictions spanning US-Canada border

**Cascadia Megaregion (Urban Core):**
- Vancouver, BC to Portland, OR corridor
- Contains 17% of Cascadian land mass
- Houses 80%+ of Cascadian population
- Defined by US and Canadian governments as formal megaregion

### Governance Structures

**Cascadia Department of Bioregion** (501(c)(3) nonprofit):
- Mission: "An independent bioregion that is regenerative, democratic, and just, as part of a world of watershed movements"
- Focus areas:
  - Ecological harmony
  - Community self-determination
  - Decentralized governance
  - Local resilience
  - Cascadian identity cultivation
- Cultural tools: Cascadia flag, Cascadia Passport
- Collaboration with Indigenous nations

**Historical Bioregional Congresses:**
- First Cascadia Bioregional Congress: The Evergreen State College (1986)
- Ish River Confluence (1987)
- Breitenbush, Oregon (1988)
- Lillooet, British Columbia (1989)
- Part of North American Bioregional Congress network (NABC, founded 1984)

### Foundational Philosophy

Origin: David McCloskey (Seattle University sociology professor) adopted "Cascadia" from Bates McKee's 1972 geology text *Cascadia: The Geologic Evolution of the Pacific Northwest*

Core principle: Cascadia described as "a land of falling waters" — the blending of natural integrity and sociocultural unity defines the bioregion

Bioregional boundaries transcend political borders based on belief that Washington/Oregon residents share more in common with British Columbia than with Washington, D.C.

## 5. Bioregional Mapping Tools

### Definition & Purpose

Bioregional mapping is:
> "A participatory approach to cartography that focuses on mapping the natural, ecological, and cultural features of a bioregion—an area defined by its natural boundaries, such as watersheds, ecosystems, and cultures that arise from a place, rather than human borders."

**Key Elements Mapped:**
- Geology, topography, tectonics
- Flora and fauna
- Soil types
- Watersheds and hydrology
- Climate patterns
- Human geography
- Energy and transportation systems
- Agriculture and food systems
- Music, language, history
- Indigenous cultures

### Major Frameworks

**One Earth Bioregions Framework:**
- 185 unique bioregions globally
- 14 realm divisions
- 52 habitable subrealms
- 844 ecoregions
- Tools: One Earth Navigator, Global Safety Net

**One Earth Realms (14 total):**
1. Subarctic America (9 bioregions)
2. Northern America (22 bioregions)
3. Central America (6 bioregions)
4. Southern America (23 bioregions)
5. Afrotropics (24 bioregions)
6. Subarctic Eurasia
7. Eastern Eurasia (16 bioregions)
8. Central Eurasia (11 bioregions)
9. Western Eurasia (13 bioregions)
10. Southern Eurasia (5 bioregions)
11. Indomalaya (18 bioregions)
12. Australasia (16 bioregions)
13. Antarctica (3 bioregions)
14. Oceania (11 bioregions)

### Mapping Tools & Resources

**Native Land Digital:**

### Community Mapping Practices

**Community Atlas Approach:**
- Participatory documentation of local knowledge
- Identification of: traditional pathways, local species, historical landmarks, stories, songs
- Maps become "focus for discussions setting a proactive plan for positive change"
- Example: *Islands of the Salish Sea: A Community Atlas*

**Process:**
1. Bioregional map atlas creation
2. Becomes common foundation of knowledge
3. Planning scenarios prepared
4. Community decisions made
5. Complex information clearly depicted
6. Community learns about itself

## 6. Indigenous Land Management Integration

### Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK)

**Definition:**
> "A cumulative body of knowledge, practice, and belief, evolving by adaptive processes and handed down through generations by cultural transmission, about the relationship of living beings (including humans) with one another and with their environment."

**Six Facets of TEK (Nicholas Houde):**
1. **Factual observations** — Recognition, naming, classification of environmental components
2. **Management systems** — Ethical and sustainable resource use; pest management, crop patterns
3. **Past and current uses** — Land use, settlement, harvest levels via oral history
4. **Ethics and values** — Environmental ethics; human-environment relationship
5. **Culture and identity** — Language, images, stories in cultural landscapes
6. **Cosmology** — Belief systems underpinning human-animal relations and existence

### Integration Successes

**Karuk and Yurok Tribes (California):**
- Traditional burning practices critical "since time immemorial"
- Fire as land management tool AND spiritual practice
- Controlled burns and fuel reduction treatments
- Results: Reduced wildfire risk, restored ecocultural resources
- Recommendation: Replicate throughout western Klamath Mountains

**Anishinaabe/Neshnabék (Great Lakes region):**
- Forefront of native species conservation
