# Sharing Economy, Greywater Recycling, Circular Construction — Direct Research Feb 20

## Sharing Economy & Tool Libraries 2025

**Core Principle:**
- "Access over ownership"
- Collective, shared resources instead of individual ownership
- Changing how we use resources

**Tool Libraries:**
- Local hubs for borrowing tools
- Power tools, kitchen equipment, specialized items
- myTurn platform used by cities, non-profits, businesses
- "Product subscription services"

**Benefits (Zero Waste Living):**
- Meet needs without owning everything
- Community building
- Resource efficiency
- New possibilities through collaborative consumption

**Digital Evolution (Emerald 2025):**
- Industry 4.0 technologies impacting sharing economy
- Blockchain, AI integration
- Platform cooperatives emerging

**Examples:**
- Tool libraries
- Little Free Library (nonprofit book sharing)
- Equipment sharing cooperatives
- Vehicle sharing

## Greywater Recycling 2025

**Barcelona Mandate (Spring 2025):**
- Greywater recycling mandatory in new buildings
- Reduce household water consumption by up to 1/3
- Hotels, office buildings, major renovations included

**MDPI Research (2025):**
- "Beginning in 2025, recycling of greywater has become mandatory"
- New residential buildings
- Hotels, offices, renovations

**Market Growth:**
- Greywater diversion systems: 60.7% market share (2025)
- Residential segment expanding significantly

**EU Framework:**
- Water reuse regulation applied from June 2023
- Commission helping EU countries implement

**Compliance (Offshore Wind MA Sept 2025):**
- Permits and codes for home-scale systems
- Legal installation guidance
- Navigating regulations

**Stormsaver Review (Dec 2025):**
- "2025 Water Reuse Round Up"
- National standards progressing
- Good year for water reuse

## Circular Construction 2025

**Definition:**
- "Creation, utilisation, and repurposing of buildings"
- Construction elements, products, materials, spaces, infrastructure

**Impact:**
- "75% of typical emissions could be avoided"
- Single key principle: circular construction

**CE Institute 5 Best Practices (2025):**
1. Designing for deconstruction
2. Adapting existing buildings
3. Material reuse
4. Component salvage
5. Systemic shift in practice

**Key Activities:**
- **Material reuse:** Components from existing construction to new projects
- **Adaptive reuse:** Existing buildings adapted for new uses
- **Deconstruction:** Careful dismantling vs demolition

**NYS White Paper (Cornell):**
- Examining paradigm shift impacts
- Operational changes
- Policy recommendations

**Academic Analysis (Zeithistorische 2025):**
- "Systemic shift from centuries-old practices"
- Salvaging and reuse → industrialization
- Circular economy as human-material relation

## Synthesis: Sharing + Water + Materials for Living Cities

| Resource | Current Approach | Living City Approach |
|----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Tools | Individual ownership | Tool library |
| Water | Once-through use | Greywater recycling |
| Materials | Demolish, landfill | Deconstruct, reuse |

**Living City Design:**

1. **Sharing Infrastructure:**
   - Tool library in every neighborhood
   - Vehicle sharing instead of ownership
   - Equipment lending programs
   - "Access over ownership" principle

2. **Water Cycling:**
   - All buildings with greywater systems
   - Toilet flushing from greywater
   - Landscape irrigation from greywater
   - Potable water for drinking/cooking only

3. **Circular Construction:**
   - Design for deconstruction required
   - Material passports for all buildings
   - Salvage before demolition mandated
   - Reused materials prioritized

**Material Flow:**
- Deconstruct old building → Sort components
- Reuse structural elements → New construction
- Process debris → Aggregate, soil amendment
- Zero construction waste target

**Metric:**
- % of goods accessed via sharing vs owned
- % of water recycled within building
- % of construction materials reused
