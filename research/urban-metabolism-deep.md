## 1. Global Material Flow Overview (2024-2025)

### Key Global Metrics (Eurostat/IRP 2025)

| Metric | Value | Trend |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Global material extraction** | ~100 Gt/year | ↑ Increasing |
| **World DMC per capita** | **13.2 tonnes** (2024) | ↑ Record high |
| **EU DMC per capita** | **13.4 tonnes** (2024) | ↓ Decreasing |
| **EU resource productivity** | **€2.36/kg** (2024) | ↑ +52% since 2000 |
| **Global circularity rate** | **7.2%** (2023) | ↓ Down from 9.1% (2018) |

### Critical Insight: Convergence Point
> "The decreasing development of EU resource use and the growing worldwide material extraction met for the first time in 2024 at 13 tonnes per capita."
> — Eurostat Material Flow Accounts 2025

### Material Consumption by Category (EU 2024)
```
Non-metallic minerals: >50% of total DMC (~7 tonnes/capita)
Biomass:              ~25% of total DMC (~3.4 tonnes/capita)  
Fossil fuels:         ~19% of total DMC (~2.5 tonnes/capita)
Metal ores:           Smallest category (~0.5 tonnes/capita)
```

## 2. Circularity Gap Report 2024/2025: Key Data

### Headline Finding
> **Global circularity has DECLINED 21%** — from 9.1% secondary materials (2018) to 7.2% (2023)

### Material Consumption Acceleration
- **500+ gigatonnes consumed** in past 5 years
- This represents **28% of ALL materials humanity has consumed since 1900**
- The circular economy "megatrend" status (discussions tripled in 5 years) contrasts with declining actual circularity

### The Circular-Development Paradox
As Human Development Index (HDI) rises, so does material footprint per capita. Countries with high HDI consume multiple "planet equivalents" worth of resources. Need: circular model that maximizes human benefit while minimizing planetary pressure.

### CGR 2025 Verdict
> "We are still far from achieving a passing grade... global circularity is still moving in reverse, highlighting the urgent need for science-based targets to drive change."

| Required annual growth | — | — | **+1.7 pp/year** |
| Actual 14-year growth | — | +1.5 pp total | — |

### Assessment
> **EU is NOT on track** to double CMUR by 2030. Required annual growth (1.7 pp) exceeds total growth achieved over entire 2010-2024 period.

|----------|------|-------|
| Metal ores | **23.4%** | Highest - technically easier to recycle |
| Non-metallic minerals | ~10% | Slight increase since 2010 |
| Biomass | ~8% | Increasing |
| Fossil materials | **3.8%** | Lowest - mostly burned, cannot recycle |

### Country Leaders in Circularity (CMUR 2024)
| Country | CMUR | Change 2010-2024 |
|---------|------|------------------|
| **Netherlands** | **32.7%** | Already exceeds 2030 target |
| **Belgium** | ~24% | Already exceeds 2030 target |
| Italy | ~23% | Major increase |

## 7. Urban Mining Potential

### Definition
Urban mining = recovering valuable materials from urban waste streams, buildings, infrastructure, and products at end-of-life

### Key Urban Mining Sources
1. **E-waste (WEEE)**
   - Fastest growing waste stream globally
   - Contains: gold, copper, rare earth elements, lithium
   - EU generates ~12 Mt/year

2. **Buildings & Infrastructure**
   - Concrete, steel, copper wiring, aluminum
   - EU building stock: ~25 billion tonnes materials
   - Renovation wave unlocking material recovery

3. **End-of-life Vehicles (ELV)**
   - ~6-7 million ELVs/year in EU
   - Steel, aluminum, platinum group metals (catalysts)
   - EV batteries: new lithium/cobalt source

4. **Mining Waste**
   - Historical tailings contain extractable materials
   - New extraction technologies improving viability

### Critical Raw Materials in Urban Mine
| Material | Primary Source Issues | Urban Mining Potential |
|----------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Rare earths | China dominance (60%+) | E-waste, magnets |
| Lithium | South America concentration | EV batteries |
| Cobalt | DRC ethical concerns | Batteries |
| Platinum group | Russia/South Africa | Catalytic converters |
| Copper | Declining ore grades | Electronics, wiring |

### Urban Mining Economics
- Traditional mining: ~1% copper ore grade
- Urban mine (e-waste): 20-30% copper content
- Challenge: Collection, sorting, processing infrastructure

## 10. Key Data Gaps & Research Needs

### Identified Gaps
1. **City-level MFA standardization**: Inconsistent methodologies across cities
2. **Real-time material tracking**: Most data is 2-3 years old
3. **Informal sector flows**: Significant in developing cities
4. **Building stock material database**: Limited for most cities
5. **Urban mining economic viability data**: Sparse and site-specific
6. **Scope 3 material footprints**: Consumption-based accounting underdeveloped

### Emerging Methodologies
- **Dynamic MFA**: Time-series material stock/flow modeling
- **AI-assisted material identification**: Computer vision for waste sorting
- **Material passports**: Digital twins tracking material composition
- **Blockchain material tracking**: Supply chain transparency

## 14. Living Cities Thesis Implications

### Key Arguments Supported by Data:

1. **Cities as material hotspots**: Urban areas concentrate 75%+ of global resource consumption

2. **Circularity gap is widening**: Despite awareness, actual material circularity declining (7.2% global)

3. **Technical potential exists**: Leading cities (Netherlands 32.7% CMUR) show much higher rates achievable

4. **Singapore model limitations**: High recycling rate but absolute waste still increasing; landfill pressure continues

5. **Brussels opportunity**: EU institutional hub could pioneer circular economy demonstration

6. **Urban mining imperative**: Critical raw materials in urban stock exceed many natural deposits

7. **Policy-practice gap**: Targets (24% CMUR by 2030) vastly exceed current trajectory (+1.5 pp over 14 years vs needed +10 pp in 6 years)

### Recommended Thesis Angles:
- Compare "mechanistic" (efficiency-focused) vs "metabolic" (systemic/regenerative) approaches
- Examine why circularity rate declining despite policy attention
- Explore city-level agency vs national/global material systems
- Question GDP-coupled resource use patterns
- Investigate informal/community circular practices vs formal waste systems
