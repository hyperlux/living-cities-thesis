# Mietshäuser Syndikat, Agroforestry, Urban Water — Direct Research Feb 20

## Mietshäuser Syndikat (Germany)

**Scale:**
- 207 Hausprojekte (housing projects) as of December 2025
- 23 project initiatives in development
- Network of collectively owned housing

**Origin:**
- Based in Freiburg, Germany
- Originated from squatting movement late 1980s
- Grether Project (1989): former factory transformed by activists

**Model:**
- Cooperative, non-commercial joint venture
- Helps communities acquire long-term affordable living space
- Legal, collective property arrangement
- Self-managed housing projects
- "Empowering residents to collectively own and manage their homes"

**Structure:**
- Haus-GmbH (house limited company) with Syndikat participation
- Collective house purchase
- Properties transferred to collective ownership
- Cannot be sold to private market

**Key Innovation:** Properties "locked" into collective ownership permanently — anti-speculation by design.

## Urban Agroforestry 2025

**UNECE Report (Feb 2025):**
- "The Edible City: Why Food Trees Matter"
- Urban food trees combine: agriculture, arboriculture, agroforestry, forestry
- Nature-based solutions

**Types:**
- Silvoarable: trees + crops on arable land
- Silvopastoral: trees + pasture/animals
- Alley cropping
- Windbreaks
- Riparian buffers
- Forest farming

**Italian Urban Planning (Springer 2025):**
- Agroforestry systems being integrated into planning
- Temperate climate adaptations

**MIT Climate (cs3):**
- "Combining agriculture with forestry could accelerate climate progress"
- "Smart growth" policies in cities
- Compact, walkable city centers + food production

**Benefits:**
- Reduce greenhouse gas emissions
- Multiple products from single land area
- Soil health improvements (MDPI 2025)

## Urban Water Commons — Berlin 2025

**Hydrocommons Concept:**
- "Basin as Hydro commons"
- FLOATING BERLIN project
- Political-ecology perspective
- Rainwater as public material

**Berlin Water Congress 2025 (May):**
- 3rd cross-state Water Congress Berlin-Brandenburg-Saxony
- 250+ experts from politics, business, science
- "Innovative solutions for secure, sustainable, resilient water supply"

**Challenges (Ecologic Institute):**
- Urban water systems under increasing pressure
- Climate-induced stressors: flooding, drought, combined sewer overflows
- Urbanization and ecosystem degradation

**Climate Impetus Berlin:**
- "Strengthening Urban Water Resilience"
- Water scarcity showing up in different ways across Europe
- Berlin situation less acute but still concerning

**Global Urban History Project:**
- Conference Berlin July 2025
- Focus areas include: urban land, urban commons, water justice

## Synthesis: Land + Food + Water Commons for Living Cities

| Resource | Model | Living City Application |
|----------|-------|------------------------|
| Housing | Mietshäuser Syndikat | Collective ownership, no resale |
| Food | Urban agroforestry | Trees + crops integrated |
| Water | Hydrocommons | Rainwater as public resource |

**Common Principles:**
1. **Collective ownership:** Resources held by community, not market
2. **Long-term stewardship:** Cannot be sold/privatized
3. **Multi-function:** Land serves multiple purposes (housing+food, water+ecosystem)
4. **Democratic governance:** Residents/users control decisions

**Living City Design:**

1. **Housing Syndikat model:**
   - All housing in collective ownership
   - No individual resale rights
   - Cross-subsidy between projects

2. **Agroforestry integration:**
   - Trees throughout all public space
   - Food production integrated with landscape
   - Silvoarable in community gardens

3. **Water commons:**
   - Rainwater harvested communally
   - Blue-green infrastructure
   - Water justice principles

**Metric:**
- 100% housing in collective ownership
- % of land in agroforestry
- % of water from local sources
