# AI Governance and Digital Democracy Tools: 2025-2026 Research

## Executive Summary

This research surveys the state of AI governance and digital democracy infrastructure in 2025-2026. The field shows strong growth in participatory platforms (Decidim now spans 489+ instances across 32 countries), maturing deliberation tools (Polis deployments reaching national scale), and emerging AI-augmented governance experiments. Key findings:

- **Scaling successes**: Decidim, Polis, and mini-public models are achieving institutional adoption
- **AI integration accelerating**: Constitutional AI, deliberative polling on AI policy, LLM-mediated governance
- **Notable failures**: Madrid's Observatorio retraction, low-engagement liquid democracy experiments, siloed tooling
- **Taiwan remains the north star**: vTaiwan and g0v continue setting global standards for civic tech

**Deployment Scenarios**
- Business: Employee involvement in organizational decisions
- Government: Caucus negotiations, constituent empowerment
- Public administration: Co-creation, deliberation, restoring trust
- NGOs: Member empowerment, democratic self-governance
- Cooperatives: Employee-owned companies
- Social movements: Collective agenda setting

**Technical Features**

- Automatic data migration on updates
- Active Directory/LDAP/OAuth2 integration
- SQL database (no vendor lock-in)

## 8. What Failed (Or Struggles)

### Platform Failures

**Madrid Observatorio de la Ciudad (2018)**
- Promising direct democracy reform
- Retracted within months of establishment
- Cause: Political changeover, institutional resistance

**Pure Liquid Democracy Experiments**
- Pirate Party implementations showed declining engagement
- Delegation chains concentrated power
- "Always-on democracy" proved cognitively exhausting

**Democracy Earth Sovereign**
- Ambitious blockchain voting platform
- Pivoted away from original vision
- Challenges: UX complexity, scaling, regulatory uncertainty

### Engagement Challenges

**Participation Inequality**
- Digital participation skews educated, connected
- SMS outreach in Global South shows different demographic

**"Participation Theater"**
- Consultations without binding commitment
- Trust erosion when input ignored
- vTaiwan's binding process shows alternative

**Sustained Engagement**
- One-time participation vs. ongoing involvement
- Decidim's ephemeral verification addresses symptom not cause

### Technical Fragmentation

**Interoperability Gaps**
- Platforms don't share data standards
- Metagov Interoperable Deliberative Tools project addressing
- CSV export/import improvements in progress

**AI Governance Legitimacy Questions**
- Who speaks for "the public"?
- Representative sampling challenges
- Anthropic's 1,000 Americans—sufficient for Constitutional AI?

## 9. Synthesis: Implications for Urban Governance

### For Living Cities Thesis

**Infrastructure Layer**
- Decidim provides proven open-source base
- Can be customized for urban sensing, participatory sensing integration
- API extensibility enables AI system integration

**Deliberation Layer**
