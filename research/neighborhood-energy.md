# Neighborhood-Scale Energy Systems: Research Deep Dive 2025

## Executive Summary

Neighborhood-scale energy systems represent a paradigm shift from centralized utility monopolies to distributed, community-controlled energy infrastructure. This document examines the major models: Community Choice Aggregation (CCA), Virtual Power Plants (VPP), energy cooperatives (particularly German REScoops and the Schönau model), neighborhood batteries, and microgrid islanding capabilities.

## 1. Community Choice Aggregation (CCA)

### Definition & Structure
Community Choice Aggregation enables local governments to aggregate the buying power of individual customers within defined jurisdictions to secure alternative energy supply contracts. CCAs choose the power generation source on behalf of consumers while incumbent utilities maintain transmission/distribution infrastructure.

### Geographic Scope
- **9 U.S. states** have CCA-enabling legislation: Massachusetts, Ohio, California, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Virginia, New Hampshire
- Collectively serving **~15% of Americans** across **1,850+ municipalities** (2024)

### California CCA Data (Market Leader)

#### Scale & Participation
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Active CCAs | 23 |
| Customers served | >10 million |
| Cities/counties | 180+ |
| Typical participation rate | 90-95% (opt-out model) |

#### Generation Capacity & Investment
- **21,000+ MW** contracted through long-term PPAs (10+ years)
- **9,700+ MW** already operational

## 5. Islanding Capabilities & Microgrids

### Islanding Definition
Intentional or unintentional disconnection of a local grid section from the main grid, operating independently with local generation.

### Intentional Islanding Benefits
- **Resilience**: Local failures contained, don't cascade
- **Emergency power**: Critical systems continue during grid outages
- **Defense in depth**: Multiple independent islands prevent total collapse
- **Grid management**: Load balancing during stress events

### Microgrid Types

| Type | Characteristics | Examples |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| **Campus/Institutional** | Single owner, multiple buildings | Universities, hospitals |
| **Community** | Multiple homes, shared storage | Residential neighborhoods |
| **Remote/Off-grid** | Never connects to macrogrid | Islands, rural areas |
| **Military** | Physical/cyber security focus | Defense installations |
| **Commercial/Industrial** | Manufacturing reliability | Data centers, factories |

### Microgrid Architecture
- **AC Microgrid**: All sources convert to AC bus
- **DC Microgrid**: All sources convert to DC bus
- **Hybrid**: Both AC and DC buses with bidirectional converter

### Key Components
1. **Distributed generation**: Solar PV, wind, biogas, micro-CHP
2. **Energy storage**: Batteries, flywheels, thermal storage
3. **Controllable loads**: Adjustable consumption (heat pumps, EVs)
4. **Point of Common Coupling (PCC)**: Grid connection point with isolation switch
5. **Microgrid controller**: Manages islanding transition, frequency/voltage regulation

### Islanding Challenges
- **Frequency/voltage stability**: Must maintain without grid reference
- **Protection systems**: Low fault currents complicate selective operation
- **Resynchronization**: Phase matching required before reconnection
- **Load balancing**: Generation must match demand precisely

### Real-World Examples

#### Eigg, Scotland (Inner Hebrides)
- Remote island microgrid
- Mix of wind, solar, hydro
- Community-owned and operated

#### California Post-2019 Shutoffs
- Increased interest in home-level islanding
- Tesla Powerwall + solar enabling residential islands
- Critical load management through frequency-responsive devices

### Neighborhood Battery Initiatives

#### Victoria, Australia (Proposed)
- State government "Neighbourhood Battery Initiative"
- Community-scale storage for solar export management
- Reduces grid congestion, improves local resilience

#### Community Battery Benefits
- Store excess rooftop solar
- Reduce peak demand charges
- Provide backup during outages
- Enable local energy trading
