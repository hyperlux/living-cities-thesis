# Participatory Cities, Senior Cohousing, Food Forests — Direct Research Feb 20

## Every One Every Day (Barking & Dagenham)

**The Experiment:**
- Launched November 2017
- Partnership: Participatory City + Barking and Dagenham Council
- Goal: "Large-scale, fully inclusive, practical participatory ecosystem"
- "First one of its kind in the world"
- 5-year initiative

**Scale Achieved:**
- Network of 1000s of people across borough
- Collaborated on different projects/activities
- "Make everyday life a little bit better, for everyone"

**Lessons (Both Positive and Cautionary):**
- "Groundbreaking funding" attracted
- **BUT** ended amid controversy
- Municipal Enquiry analysis: "Tragic, if not farcical"
- Warning about projects designed without substantive input from community
- "Domain of social designers, local authorities, funders"

**Key Learning:** Participatory systems must be genuinely community-led, not designed FOR communities by external experts.

**Esmee Fairbairn Report (Oct 2025):**
- Learning from place-led funding
- Every One Every Day alongside POP Plymouth, SCVO
- Insights being documented

## Senior Cohousing 2025

**Market Growth:**
- "Expanding across America"
- Global population aging: 1 in 6 over 60 by 2030
- Seniors worldwide: 1B (2020) → 1.4B by 2030

**The Model:**
- "Living independently with community backup"
- "Not an institution, and not alone"
- Resident-led, thoughtfully designed
- Shared spaces + private units

**Guardian Analysis (July 2025):**
- "A vastly superior way to live"
- "Joyful and fulfilling experience of ageing"
- Growing demand

**Phoenix Commons:**
- Opened 2016
- Designed and built specifically for older adults
- Part of Cohousing Association of US

**Multigenerational Option:**
- Blends seniors, singles, young families
- "Supportive neighborhood where everyone contributes and benefits"
- Not age-segregated

**Academic Review (Tandfonline 2025):**
- Community-based housing for older adults
- 4 citations
- Focus on minoritised older adults

## Urban Food Forests 2025

**ScienceDirect Systematic Review:**
- "Urban food forests: Seeing the fruit for the trees"
- Multi-functional method of urban food production
- Nature-based solution
- Positive contribution to urban ecosystems

**UNECE Report:**
- "The Edible City: Why Food Trees Matter"
- Food forest planting for urban single-family homes
- Temperate climate permaculture

**Key Benefits:**
- Food production
- Biodiversity by design
- Climate resilience
- Community gathering space

**Design Principles:**
- Permaculture-based
- Multi-layer: canopy, understory, shrub, herbaceous, groundcover, vine, root

## Synthesis: Community Infrastructure for Living Cities

| Element | Key Learning | Application |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Participatory Systems | Must be community-led, not designed FOR community | Governance from residents up |
| Senior Cohousing | "Community backup, not institution" | Intergenerational mixing built-in |
| Food Forests | Multi-functional, minimal maintenance | Every neighborhood has one |

**Living City Design:**

1. **Participation:**
   - No external "designers" imposing systems
   - Every One Every Day cautionary tale
   - Residents design their own structures

2. **Aging in Place:**
   - Senior cohousing principles throughout
   - Not age-segregated buildings
   - "Independent with community backup"

3. **Food Production:**
   - Food forests in all public spaces
   - 7-layer design
   - Community gathering + food

**Metric:**
- % of decisions made by residents (vs external)
- Aging-in-place capability score
- Food forest area per resident
