- Embracing cooperative model

**Key Advantage:**
- Invest in community facilities and jobs
- "Where traditional banks won't"

**5 Key Lessons from 2025 (PixelSpoke Jan 2026):**
- Credit unions adapting to changing landscape
- Community focus remaining central
- Digital transformation ongoing

## Synthesis: Living Materials + Living Finance

**Connection:**

1. **Mycelium materials** = living biology in construction
   - Grows from agricultural waste
   - Compostable at end of life
   - Fire resistant, acoustic absorption
   - Local production possible

2. **Credit unions** = living finance in community
   - Member-owned
   - Local decision-making
   - Profits stay in community
   - CDFI designation for low-income areas

**Living City Application:**

| Organ | Mycelium Materials | Credit Union |
|-------|-------------------|--------------|
| Housing | Insulation, panels | Mortgage lending |
| Making | Local mycelium farm | Working capital |
| Food | Mushroom production (co-product) | Farm loans |
| Exchange | Packaging for local products | Community currency backing |
| Land | Carbon-negative construction | CLT financing |

**Design Principle:** Living Cities should:
1. Use mycelium materials where appropriate (insulation, packaging, panels)
2. Establish or partner with credit union/CDFI for internal finance
3. Close the loop: agricultural waste → mycelium → construction → compost → agriculture

**Metric:**
- % of construction using bio-based materials
- % of residents using cooperative banking
- Material circularity rate
