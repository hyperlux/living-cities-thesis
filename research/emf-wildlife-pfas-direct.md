# EMF, Urban Wildlife, PFAS Pollution — Direct Research Feb 20

## EMF & Electromagnetic Pollution 2025

**Scientific Status (Swedish Radiation Safety Authority April 2025):**
- Review of studies from Jan 2023 - Dec 2023
- EMF and health risks evaluated
- Ongoing research program

**Current Evidence (Ecreee Feb 2026):**
- "Current scientific evidence does not support claim that typical residential power line EMF exposure causes significant health risks"
- 2025 perspective on power lines

**European Mapping (Project GOLIAT May 2025):**
- RF-EMF exposure across seven European countries
- Low-cost sensor innovation
- "Lower levels in cities compared to villages"
- Netherlands highest exposure

**Precautionary Approach (SpiroEMF):**
- "Electromagnetic pollution free environments"
- Exposure minimized to levels compatible with public health
- Safer technologies
- Low-emission options

**Living City Position:** While evidence is mixed, precautionary design makes sense — minimize unnecessary EMF where possible.

## Urban Wildlife Habitat 2025

**Bird Conservation (Environment Americas Feb 2025):**
- "Restoring Urban Habitats for Bird Conservation"
- Communities actively restoring nature in urban areas
- Make cities viable habitats for local wildlife
- Valuable stopover for migratory birds

**Threats (Nature 2025 - 9 citations):**
- Urban and cropland expansion impacts natural habitats
- Threatened bird species most affected
- Followed by mammals and amphibians

**Design Solutions (Rissover Foundation Aug 2025):**
- "Urban Wild: Reimagining Cities as Living Ecosystems"
- "Designing for Coexistence"
- Bird-safe glass (reduces collisions — nearly 1 billion birds/year killed in North America)
- Green roofs for habitat
- Building facades with nesting sites for birds and bats

**EU Habitats Directive:**
- Protects 1,000+ species
- Mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish, invertebrates, plants
- 230 characteristic habitats

**Forbes (June 2025):**
- "Urban Rewilding Makes Cities More Biodiverse"
- "Better for Our Health"

**Key Framing:** Cities can be wildlife refuges — design determines whether species thrive or disappear.

## PFAS "Forever Chemicals" 2025-2026

**Scale of Crisis (EWG Aug 2025):**
- 9,552 contaminated sites in US
- 50 states + DC + 4 territories
- Interactive map available

**European Scale (Forever Pollution Project):**
- Nearly 23,000 contaminated sites across Europe
- Tracking PFAS pollution

**Economic Cost (EU Jan 2026):**
- "Huge and growing costs of PFAS pollution"
- €440 billion by 2050 (EU alone)
- Current contamination levels

**UK PFAS Plan (Feb 2026):**
- "Building a safer future together"
- "One of the most pressing chemical challenges of our time"
- Forever chemicals require forever vigilance

**Widespread Contamination (Northeastern Sept 2025):**
- "More Widespread Than Thought"
- In everything: Band-Aids, clothing, water, floss
- Industrial polluters need more attention

**EU Water Response (CINEA Aug 2025):**
- "Restoring LIFE to Europe's polluted water supplies"
- Highly toxic PFAS identified
- Water supply protection urgent

**Key Framing:** PFAS are everywhere and last forever — elimination at source is only solution.

## Synthesis: Real Pollution Priorities for Living Cities

| Pollution Type | Evidence | Living City Response |
|---------------|----------|---------------------|
| EMF | Mixed/precautionary | Minimize where practical |
| Wildlife loss | Clear (43% pollinator, 1B bird deaths) | Design for coexistence |
| PFAS | Clear (23,000+ sites, €440B cost) | Eliminate completely |

**Living City Design:**

1. **EMF Precaution:**
   - Buried power lines
   - Fiber optic preferred over wireless where practical
   - Low-EMF design standards
   - No unnecessary transmitters

2. **Wildlife Design:**
   - Bird-safe glass required
   - Nesting sites in buildings
   - Green roofs throughout
   - Wildlife corridors connecting habitats
   - Night-friendly lighting

3. **PFAS Elimination:**
   - Zero PFAS in any product
   - Water testing mandatory
   - Contaminated sites remediated
   - No industrial PFAS use
   - Precautionary principle for new chemicals

**Metric:**
- EMF levels in residential areas
- Bird collision rate per building
- PFAS concentration in water/soil
