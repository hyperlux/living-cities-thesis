# Sponge Cities & Solidarity Economy — Direct Research Feb 20

## Sponge City Concept

**Definition:**
- Cities that absorb, store, and reuse rainwater like a sponge
- Combination of natural and engineered infrastructure
- Alternative to pipe-it-away drainage systems

**Key Elements:**
1. Permeable surfaces (pavements, soils)
2. Green roofs
3. Rainwater harvesting systems
4. Bioswales and wetlands
5. Urban forests

**Singapore Case Study:**
- Tropical island with abundant rainfall
- Highest annual rainfall rising over 30 years
- Yet minimal urban flooding
- "Well-regulated, strict standards"
- Science-based design
- Distributed rainwater harvesting + drainage systems

**Benefits:**
- Reduce flooding
- Conserve water
- Reduce dependence on centralized water systems
- Address both flood AND drought disasters
- Long-term climate resilience

**Research (ScienceDirect 2025):**
- 11 cities analyzed: North America, Europe, Australia
- Focus on stormwater management for climate change
- 23 citations in first year

## Solidarity Economy — Latin America 2025

**UN Recognition:**
- 2023: UN General Assembly resolution on Social and Solidarity Economy
- "Major milestone" serving as global reference
- Framework for alternative economic systems

**Brazil:**
- Community banks operating on solidarity principles
- "Unique community-based organizations"
- Principles: solidarity, equity, community control

**Aratu Social Currency (Brazil 2025):**
- Blockchain-based social currency
- Created by Plexos + Chainlink + EDinheiro
- Launched in Indiaroba (small community in northeast Brazil)
- Forbes coverage (July 2025)

**Argentina — Moneda PAR:**
- Blockchain-based social currency
- Case study for academic research
- Examining currency performance on trust dimensions
- Action research methodology

**Academic Analysis:**
- Digital solidarity economy + free culture in Latin America
- "Beyond platform capitalism" framework
- Municipal currencies as "new municipalist instrument"

**Key Finding:** Solidarity economy "isn't a dream, it's already happening" — operational at community scale across Global South.

## Synthesis: Water + Economic Sovereignty

**Both sponge cities and solidarity economies share:**

1. **Decentralization:** Moving away from centralized infrastructure to distributed systems
2. **Local control:** Community-level management
3. **Resilience:** Able to weather external shocks (drought, financial crisis)
4. **Integration with natural systems:** Water follows natural flows; currency follows trust networks

**Living City Application:**

| Organ | Sponge City | Solidarity Economy |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| Water | Rainwater harvesting, bioswales | — |
| Exchange | — | Social currency, time banking |
| Land | Permeable surfaces, green roofs | Community land trusts |
| Food | Wetland-irrigated agriculture | Food cooperatives |

**Design Principle:** Living Cities should capture their own water AND circulate their own currencies, reducing dependence on external centralized systems.
