# Aging Populations & Modular Housing — Direct Research Feb 20

## Japan Aging Society 2025

**The "2025 Problem":**
- All post-war baby boomers (1947-1949) now aged 75+
- Over 18% of country becomes "late-stage elderly"
- Elderly percentage: 29.3% (Oct 2024)
- 36.57 million elderly in 2025 → peak 38.78 million in 2042

**Urban Implications:**
- Demographic shift from countryside to small number of cities
- Pressure on: healthcare, transport, public parks
- "Super-Aged Society" requiring new urban design

**Innovations:**
- Advanced healthcare technologies
- Policy reforms for sustainability
- IoT and smart city integration for elderly support

**BCG Analysis (2025):**
- By 2050: 2.1 billion people aged 60+
- 1.5 billion will live in urban areas
- Cities must adapt: transport, parks, services

**Real Estate Impact:**
- Shrinking population → housing surplus in rural areas
- Pressure on urban core properties
- New demand for age-appropriate housing design

## Modular/Prefab Housing 2025

**Cost Structure:**
- $80-160 per square foot installed
- Complete homes: $240,000-270,000 average
- **10-25% cost savings** vs traditional construction

**Speed:**
- "Cut build times in half"
- Factory-controlled environment eliminates weather delays
- Multiple modules built simultaneously

**Quality:**
- Must comply with same local building codes as traditional
- Permanent, high-quality homes designed to last decades
- Factory precision often exceeds site-built quality

**Market Growth:**
- Germany: €43.08 billion market (2025), growing 3.4% annually
- Dominates because: cost certainty, sustainability, speed
- Forbes coverage: "Good design, efficiency, and value"

**Key Advantages:**
1. Labor efficiency (fewer on-site workers)
2. Time savings (parallel construction)
3. Cost predictability (factory-controlled)
4. Waste reduction (optimized material use)
5. Quality consistency (controlled environment)

## Synthesis: Age-Appropriate Modular Living Cities

**Connection:**

1. **Aging populations need:**
   - Accessible design (universal design principles)
   - Walkable neighborhoods (15-minute city)
   - Healthcare integration
   - Community connection (anti-isolation)

2. **Modular construction enables:**
   - Rapid deployment of age-friendly housing
   - Consistent accessibility features
   - Lower cost = more affordable for fixed-income elderly
   - Factory customization for mobility needs

**Living City Application:**

| Organ | Aging Response | Modular Approach |
|-------|----------------|------------------|
| Housing | Universal design, single-floor options | Factory-built accessible units |
| Care | Integrated health services | Pre-wired smart home sensors |
| Mobility | Walkable, AV-served | Ground-floor priority |
| Community | Intergenerational mixing | Flexible module configurations |

**Design Principle:** Living Cities should be designed for 100-year residents — children who will age in place. Modular construction allows adaptation as needs change.

**Metric:** % of housing that is accessible + average age-in-place potential
