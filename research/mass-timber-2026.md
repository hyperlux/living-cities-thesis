# Mass Timber Construction 2025-2026: Research Summary

## Executive Overview

Mass timber construction has reached a pivotal moment in 2025-2026. With the 2021 International Building Code (IBC) provisions now fully implemented allowing buildings up to 18 stories, and regional codes continuing to evolve, the industry has transitioned from proof-of-concept to mainstream adoption. This document covers CLT building codes adoption, tallest timber buildings, fire safety evidence, carbon storage calculations, and cost comparisons with traditional materials.

## 1. Building Codes & Regulatory Adoption

### International Building Code (IBC) 2021

The 2021 IBC introduced three new construction types for mass timber:

| Type | Max Stories | Fire Protection Requirements |
|------|-------------|------------------------------|
| **Type IV-A** | 18 stories | Noncombustible protection on ALL mass timber elements |
| **Type IV-B** | 12 stories | Limited-area exposed mass timber walls/ceilings allowed |
| **Type IV-C** | 9 stories | All mass timber may be exposed (with exceptions, e.g., shafts); designed for 2-hour fire resistance |

These provisions apply to Business and Residential occupancies. The code requires specified hourly fire-resistance ratings and added noncombustible protection levels.

### Regional Code Updates (2024-2026)

- **British Columbia (Canada)**: 2024 B.C. Codes enable mass timber buildings up to **18 storeys** for residential and office buildings, with provisions for more exposed mass timber or fewer layers of encapsulation depending on building height.

- **Canada National Building Code**: 2020 and 2025 amendments permit tall wood buildings; the GCWood program (established October 2017) continues to support demonstrations.

- **European Standards**: EN 16351 (2015) remains the product standard for CLT in Europe. European Technical Assessments (ETA) regulate CLT properties and design.

- **United States**: ANSI/APA PRG 320 governs CLT specifications. The 2021 IBC provisions are now active in most jurisdictions.

### Key Milestone: CLT in Building Codes
CLT was incorporated into the International Building Code in 2015 (via ANSI/APA PRG 320). National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) research on fire safety of CLT began the same year.

## 4. Fire Safety: Evidence & Performance

### Inherent Fire Resistance Properties

Mass timber demonstrates **predictable fire behavior** due to charring:

- When exposed to heat/flame, wood forms an outer **char layer** that insulates the interior
- Char layer prevents fire from reaching inner wood, maintaining structural integrity
- Mass timber elements are sized so structures remain stable even with surface charring

### Fire Ratings

- **CLT Classification**: REI 90 – Retains load-bearing capacity and integrity for **90 minutes** during fire exposure
- **D-Class Fire Rating**: Wood is inherently flammable but performs predictably
- **Comparison**: Unprotected steel loses load-bearing capacity after only **15 minutes** of fire exposure

### Code Requirements

All buildings must meet the **same fire safety performance** regardless of material:
- Type IV-A (18 stories): Requires noncombustible protection on all timber
- Type IV-B (12 stories): Limited exposed timber allowed
- Type IV-C (9 stories): 2-hour fire resistance design required

### Fire Testing Programs

- **US Forest Service & USDA**: Supported fire testing through Wood Innovation Grants (Ascent MKE received 2019 grant)
- **Natural Resources Canada**: TWBDI and GCWood programs include fire safety demonstrations
- **NFPA Research**: Ongoing code development for engineered wood fire safety

### Real-World Performance

Mass timber buildings have demonstrated fire performance in multiple construction fires during building phase. The char-layer phenomenon provides a **self-protecting mechanism** not available with steel structures.

## 5. Carbon Storage & Environmental Benefits

### Carbon Sequestration Fundamentals

Trees absorb CO₂ during growth; wood stores that carbon for the product's lifespan. When wood is not incinerated at end-of-life:

| Material | Carbon Impact |
|----------|---------------|
| **Laminated wood** | Absorbs ~**582 kg CO₂/m³** (sequestration) |
| **Reinforced concrete** | Emits **458 kg CO₂/m³** |
| **Steel** | Emits **12,087 kg CO₂/m³** |

### Embodied Carbon Comparison

Steel and cement production accounted for approximately **9% of global CO₂ emissions** (2014 data):
- Steel production: ~1,320 Mt CO₂
- Cement production: ~1,740 Mt CO₂

Studies estimate mass timber could eliminate approximately **50 Mt CO₂e by 2050** through hybrid construction (not including sequestration benefits).

### Life Cycle Assessment Standards

- **ISO 21930** governs life-cycle assessment for wood products
- Biogenic carbon (sequestered) can only be counted as negative input when wood originates from **sustainably managed forests**

### Thermal Performance

CLT panels provide excellent insulation:
- **Thermal conductivity**: ~0.1016 W/m⋅K
- Traditional materials range 0.4 to 2.5 W/m⋅K
- Wood layers act as **thermal mass**, reducing building energy use

### Sustainability Credentials

- Renewable resource (when sustainably harvested)
- Lower carbon footprint than steel/concrete alternatives
- **LEED Gold** certification achievable (Brock Commons designed to LEED Gold)
- C-CLT (Circular CLT) innovation: Uses demolition wood and pallets, creating **10-15% stronger panels** while upcycling waste

## 6. Cost Comparison: Mass Timber vs. Steel/Concrete

### Cost Competitiveness Factors

Mass timber cost parity with traditional construction depends on multiple variables:

**Cost Advantages:**
- **Faster construction times**: Brock Commons' timber structure completed in **57 days** (9 workers, ~2 floors/week)
- **Reduced foundation requirements**: Lighter weight = smaller foundations = less concrete
- **Prefabrication efficiency**: Components manufactured to precise tolerances, arrive ready to install
- **Reduced on-site labor**: Fewer workers needed; described as "like Lego" assembly
- **Shorter schedules**: Reduced financing costs, earlier occupancy revenue

**Cost Challenges:**
- Limited North American production (concentrated in Pacific Northwest)
- Transportation costs for long-distance delivery
- Production costs higher due to newer technology and limited demand volume
- Insurance considerations (improving as industry matures)
- Specialized design/engineering requirements

### Project Cost Examples

- **Brock Commons Tallwood House**: $51.5 million total (18 storeys, 15,120 m², 404 students)

### Cost Trends (2024-2026)

- Increasing domestic CLT production in North America reducing transportation costs
- Insurance industry education improving (guides now available for Canadian insurers)
- Growing contractor/engineer experience reducing design/permitting costs
- Economies of scale emerging as more projects built

### Indirect Cost Benefits

- Reduced neighborhood disruption during construction
- Improved safety (fewer on-site accidents)
- Less waste generated on site
- Marketing/leasing premium for sustainability

| **Glulam (Glue-Laminated Timber)** | Dimensional timber layers glued parallel; can be curved | Beams, columns, long spans |
| **NLT (Nail-Laminated Timber)** | Parallel boards fastened with nails; century-old method | Floors, roofs, walls |
| **DLT (Dowel-Laminated Timber)** | Wood-on-wood connection without adhesives or metal | Panels (no VOC concerns) |
| **PSL (Parallel Strand Lumber)** | Long veneer strands bonded; high load capacity | Heavy beams, columns |
| **LSL (Laminated Strand Lumber)** | Short flaked strands; good fastener holding | Headers, studs, rim boards |

### Innovation: Circular-CLT (C-CLT)

Introduced in 2024 in the Netherlands:
- Made from **demolition wood and discarded pallets**
- Outer layers of ash wood
- **10-15% stronger** than traditional CLT
- Complies with European regulations
- First used in The Urban Woods building (June 2024)

## 8. Design Considerations

### Structural Performance
- High in-plane and out-of-plane strength/stiffness
- Excellent seismic performance (wood is naturally ductile)
- Lighter weight = reduced foundation loads
- Cross-lamination prevents splitting

### Key Design Challenges

| Challenge | Solutions |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Acoustics** | Decoupled gypsum board, increased panel thickness, concrete toppings |
| **Vibration** | Floor design optimization, increased mass |
| **Moisture** | Protection during construction, proper detailing |
| **Connection Design** | Steel connectors, tested proprietary systems |

### Hybrid Systems

Mass timber frequently combined with:
- Concrete shear walls/cores (Brock Commons, HoHo Wien)
