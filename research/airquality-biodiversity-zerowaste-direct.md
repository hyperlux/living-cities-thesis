# Air Quality, Urban Biodiversity, Zero Waste — Direct Research Feb 20

## Air Quality & Health 2025

**Global Impact (Clean Air Fund March 2025):**
- Poor air quality = loss of nearly 5% global GDP
- Health impacts, lost productivity, reduced life expectancy
- Policies achieving multiple goals most efficient

**WHO (2025):**
- "Air pollution: critical driver of global NCD crisis"
- Halving health impact would prevent ~4 million deaths annually
- ~3 million from non-communicable diseases
- Success stories from countries with robust legislation

**EU Status (EEA 2025):**
- "EU air quality standards still not fully met"
- BUT ongoing overall improvements
- Since 2011: all countries reduced PM2.5 exposure
- Fine particles most harmful pollutant

**US EPA Progress:**
- "Dramatic reductions in air pollution"
- "Preventing hundreds of thousands of cases of serious health effects"
- Clean Air Act working

**WEF Alliance for Clean Air:**
- Cities, businesses, innovators together
- Scalable clean air solutions
- Transport and Urbanism workstream (2025)
- Mobility options → air quality → sustainable growth

**Key Framing:** Air quality is a HEALTH issue — cleaner air means fewer sick people, higher productivity, longer lives.

## Urban Biodiversity & Wildlife Corridors 2025

**The Challenge (Journal of Applied Ecology 2025):**
- Urban sprawl reducing and fragmenting habitat
- Built surface increase = wildlife impact
- 30x30 target requires connectivity

**Wildlife Corridors (URBACT Siena Sept 2025):**
- Connect fragmented habitats
- Improve population stability
- Enable wildlife movement
- Facilitate feeding and reproduction

**Design Elements:**
- Green roofs
- Parks
- Designed streetscapes
- Green streets with native plantings
- Urban forests

**Backyard to Hotspot (Environmental Blog Sept 2025):**
- "Green links between larger green spaces"
- Allow species to travel, feed, reproduce
- Individual gardens can participate

**Cities as Living Ecosystems (Rissover Aug 2025):**
- "Urban Wild: Reimagining Cities as Living Ecosystems"
- Native plantings create pollinator corridors
- Urban forests increase canopy cover
- Moderate temperatures (heat relief)
- Support diverse species

**Key Framing:** Wildlife corridors make cities more ALIVE — more birds, pollinators, diverse species.

## Zero Waste Cities 2025

**Zero Waste Europe Strategic Framework 2025-2030:**
- "Phase out waste — not by burning or landfilling"
- "Systems that do not generate waste in the first place"
- Circular economy principles in legislation
- Waste prevention, reuse focus

**Kiel, Germany — First German Zero Waste City:**
- Certified Zero Waste City
- Eliminate waste
- Circular economy introduction
- Model for other German cities

**C40 Towards Zero Waste Accelerator:**
- Fast-track zero waste systems
- Construction debris → new buildings
- Communities enabled to reuse
- "Good green jobs and circular economies"

**Circular Economy 2.0 (IICSR 2025):**
- Cutting raw material use by 20%
- Biobased or reused materials mandated
- Digital passports track materials
- Future reuse enabled

**China Scale:**
- National zero-waste pilot in 11 cities
- Success → expanded to 113 cities
- Five-Year Plan integration

**Key Framing:** Zero waste means NO LANDFILLS, NO BURNING — materials stay in use, nothing poisoning land or air.

## Synthesis: Health + Life + Circularity for Living Cities

| Goal | Metric | Why It Matters |
|------|--------|----------------|
| Clean Air | PM2.5 levels | People live longer, healthier |
| Biodiversity | Species count, corridor coverage | Cities feel alive |
| Zero Waste | Landfill diversion rate | No poisoned land |

**Living City Design:**

1. **Air Quality First:**
   - No combustion vehicles in core
   - No burning of anything
   - Industrial emissions eliminated
   - Trees and vegetation for natural filtration

2. **Wildlife Corridors:**
   - Connected green spaces
   - Native plantings throughout
   - Urban forest canopy 40%+
   - Green roofs required
   - Cities as habitat, not just human space

3. **Zero Waste Systems:**
   - Design out waste at source
   - Materials track via passports
   - Reuse infrastructure standard
   - No landfills, no incinerators
   - Construction debris → new buildings

**Metric:**
- Days/year meeting WHO air quality guidelines
- Species diversity index
- % waste diverted from landfill/incineration
