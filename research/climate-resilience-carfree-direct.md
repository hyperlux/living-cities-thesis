# Climate Resilience & Car-Free Cities — Direct Research Feb 20

## Climate Resilient Infrastructure 2025

**Core Challenge:**
- "Global efforts to slow climate change are promising, but insufficient"
- Building resilience is high priority for cities
- Infrastructure must withstand floods, heatwaves, heavy storms

**Key Strategies (SIERA Alliance):**
1. **Green Infrastructure:** Parks, urban forests, wetlands
   - Absorb stormwater
   - Reduce urban heat
   
2. **Adapted Infrastructure:**
   - Roads, bridges, public transport designed for extremes
   - Climate-resilient materials

3. **Coastal/Flooding:**
   - Comprehensive solutions (not just seawalls)
   - Deployable flood barriers for short-term protection

**AI Integration (Logiciel 2025):**
- "Predictive Climate Infrastructure"
- AI predicts floods, heat, infrastructure stress
- Design climate-resilient cities proactively

**UNDP Framework:**
- "Ensuring climate change resilience protects lives and livelihoods"
- Reduces direct losses from extreme weather

**Sweco (Oct 2025):**
- "Creating infrastructure that adapts and endures"
- Urban areas expanding, populations growing

## Car-Free Cities / Neighborhoods 2025

**Pontevedra, Spain — The Pioneer:**
- "City that pioneered Europe's car-free future"
- Drastically reduced car access in core since 1999
- "Banned cars decades before most cities started thinking about it"
- "This isn't a dream; it's reality"

**Oslo, Norway:**
- First European capital to completely ban cars in central areas (2019)
- National capital going car-free in center

**Freiburg, Germany (Vauban District):**
- Almost entirely car-free district
- Bikes account for ~30% of all journeys
- Urban planning involves local people

**Barcelona Superblocks:**
- Could prevent 36 premature deaths annually
- From increased physical activity alone
- Mental health improves with green space

**Den Haag, Netherlands:**
- Zero Emission Zone for logistics in 2025
- Urban vehicle access regulations expanding

**Academic Analysis (ScienceDirect 2025):**
- "Mind the gap: comparative study of low-car policy acceptance"
- 3 citations
- Swedish car-free street experiments studied

**Green European Journal:**
- "Made for People, Not Cars: Reclaiming European Cities"
- Movement gaining momentum

## Synthesis: Resilient + Car-Free = Living City Foundation

**Connection:**

1. **Climate Resilience** requires:
   - Green infrastructure (reduces heat, absorbs water)
   - Less impervious surface (roads, parking)
   - More adaptive, less brittle systems

2. **Car-Free** provides:
   - Remove roads → add green infrastructure
   - Remove parking → add permeable surface
   - Reduce emissions at source

**They reinforce each other:** Car-free = more green space = more climate resilience

**Living City Application:**

| Challenge | Car-Free Solution | Resilience Benefit |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Flooding | Former roads → bioswales | Stormwater absorption |
| Heat | Former parking → trees | Urban cooling |
| Air quality | No vehicles | Direct emission reduction |
| Mobility | Walking, cycling, shared AV | Lower energy demand |
| Space | Reclaimed streets | Community gardens, play areas |

**Design Principle:** Living Cities should be:
- Car-free in residential core (following Pontevedra model)
- Shared AV for periphery connections
- All former road/parking space converted to green infrastructure
- Designed for climate extremes from start

**Metric:**
- % of land area that is impervious
- % of trips by walking/cycling
- Heat island differential vs surroundings
- Flood absorption capacity
