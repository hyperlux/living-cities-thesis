## 7. Emerging Frameworks & Concepts

### Minimum Viable Society (MVS)
New concept emerging (Daniel Thompson, Feb 2026):
- "Missing middle between popup and permanent"
- Fast-built, modular, multi-community, co-owned towns
- Combines: festival speed + nomad demand aggregation + network state governance + startup scalability
- Key insight: "Society is not built from similarity, it is built from interdependence"

### Four Approaches to Voluntary Sovereignty
Framework from Lucas Russo (Dec 2025):

| Approach | Sequence | Examples |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Private/Charter Cities | Laws → Territory → People | Próspera, Hong Kong, Dubai DMCC |
| Digital SEZs | Laws → People → Territory | e-Estonia, RAK DAO, MIDAO, Catawba |
| Network States | People → Territory → Laws | Praxis, Zuzalu spinoffs |
| Seasteading/Landsteading | Territory → Laws → People | (Various experiments) |

### Network School (ns.com)
Balaji's ongoing education initiative:
- "Learn, Earn, and Burn" model
- $100k fellowship program launched Apr 2025
- Near Singapore location
- Curriculum released Feb 2025
