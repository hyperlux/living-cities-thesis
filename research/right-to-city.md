# Right to the City Movement: Deep Dive Research

## Executive Summary

The "Right to the City" represents one of the most significant conceptual frameworks linking urban theory to grassroots housing activism. Originating in Henri Lefebvre's 1968 work *Le Droit à la Ville*, the concept has evolved from philosophical critique into a global organizing principle, inspiring movements from Barcelona's PAH to Berlin's expropriation campaigns to South Africa's shack dwellers.

## Part I: Theoretical Foundations

### Henri Lefebvre's Original Conception (1968)

**Core Framework:**
Henri Lefebvre (1901-1991), French Marxist philosopher and sociologist, introduced the Right to the City concept in his 1968 book *Le Droit à la Ville*, published just before the May 1968 student revolts in France.

**Key Theoretical Elements:**
- **Critique of Commodification**: Lefebvre argued that urban space had been degraded into a commodity under capitalism, with social interaction becoming uprooted and urban governance turning into exclusive goods
- **Rescue of the Citizen**: His call was to "rescue the citizen as main element and protagonist of the city that he himself had built"
- **Collective Life**: Urban space should become "a meeting point for building collective life"
- **Appropriation vs. Property**: Emphasized the right to appropriate and use space over private property rights—prioritizing *use value* over *economic value*
- **The City as Oeuvre**: Conceived the city as a collective artwork (oeuvre) actively shaped by inhabitants

**The "Cry and Demand":**
Lefebvre summarized the concept as a "demand for a transformed and renewed access to urban life." This wasn't merely about services or infrastructure, but about fundamentally transforming how urban space is produced and governed.

**Lefebvre's Broader Contributions:**
- Critique of everyday life
- Theory of moments
- Rhythmanalysis
- Production of social space
- Founding journals: Philosophies, La Revue Marxiste, Arguments, Espaces et Sociétés

**Academic Legacy:**
- Influenced Louis Althusser and Albert Camus in their encounters with Marx
- Doctoral advisor to Jean Baudrillard
- Writings on urban theory remain foundational texts in geography, sociology, and urban studies

### David Harvey's Contemporary Applications

**Key Reformulation:**
David Harvey (b. 1935), British-American geographer and Distinguished Professor at CUNY Graduate Center, has become the most influential contemporary interpreter of Lefebvre's concept.

**Harvey's Definition (New Left Review, 2008):**
> "The right to the city is far more than the individual liberty to access urban resources: it is a right to change ourselves by changing the city. It is, moreover, a common rather than an individual right since this transformation inevitably depends upon the exercise of a collective power to reshape the processes of urbanization. The freedom to make and remake our cities and ourselves is, I want to argue, one of the most precious yet most neglected of our human rights."

**Harvey's Key Contributions:**
1. **Accumulation by Dispossession**: Concept explaining how capitalism expands through privatization and displacement
2. **Spatial Analysis of Capital**: In *Limits to Capital* (1982), expanded Marxist theory on the "spatial moment" in capitalist crisis formation
3. **Critique of Neoliberalism**: *A Brief History of Neoliberalism* (2005) analyzing class reconstitution through neoliberal policies
4. **Urban Political Economy**: *Social Justice and the City* (1973) established him as leader of Marxist urban geography

**Critical Note:**
Harvey has described "right to the city" as "an empty signifier that lacks meaning"—meaning it must be filled with specific content through struggle. This openness makes it adaptable but also risks dilution.

**Critiques of Contemporary Applications:**
Scholar Marcelo Lopes de Souza has argued that as the right to the city has become "fashionable these days," "the price of this has often been the trivialisation and corruption of Lefebvre's concept." Critics note some versions reduce the concept to a "citizenship vision" focused only on social/economic rights, abandoning the transformatory nature and role of social conflict in Lefebvre's original.

## Part II: Global Housing Movements

### Barcelona: PAH (Plataforma de Afectados por la Hipoteca)

**Background & Formation:**
- Founded: February 2009 in Barcelona
- Context: Response to 2008 financial crisis and Spanish housing bubble collapse
- Founders: Activists from V de Vivienda (H for Housing) movement
- Structure: Horizontal organization by assembly

**Growth & Scale:**
- By 2017: 220 local branches across Spain
- Over 2,000 evictions successfully stopped by 2016
- Non-partisan: Does not allow political party affiliates to speak on its behalf

**Tactics:**
1. **Direct Action**: Non-violent resistance to evictions at the point of enforcement
2. **Escraches**: Public protests outside homes/offices of politicians
   - Condemned as "undemocratic" by PM Mariano Rajoy
   - Called "pure Nazism" by PP Secretary-General María Dolores de Cospedal
3. **Legal Campaigns**: Push for mortgage law reform, social rent policies
4. **Community Mutual Aid**: Support networks for affected families

**Policy Achievements:**
- 2013: Received Premio Nacional de Derechos Humanos (National Human Rights Award)
- 2013: European Citizens' Prize
- 2018: Under Mayor Ada Colau, Constitutional Court veto on expropriation of empty dwellings was lifted—potentially converting 2,000+ bank-owned vacant homes into social housing

**Key Figure: Ada Colau**
- PAH co-founder and spokesperson until May 2014
- Rose to national prominence in 2013 calling Spanish Banking Association representative "a criminal" at parliamentary hearing
- Founded Barcelona en Comú citizen platform (2014)
- Elected Mayor of Barcelona (2015-2023)—first woman to hold office
- Policy legacy: Superilles (superblocks), climate emergency declaration (2020), cruise ship restrictions, opposition to airport expansion

**Movement-to-Government Transition:**
The PAH represents a significant case of housing movement leadership translating into municipal power, demonstrating the political potential of right-to-the-city organizing while raising questions about institutionalization.

## Part VII: Key Tensions & Debates

### 1. Institutionalization vs. Radical Transformation
- Risk of diluting transformative demands when movements enter government
- PAH-to-Colau trajectory raises questions about movement co-optation
- Tension between immediate reforms and systemic change

### 2. "Empty Signifier" Problem
- Harvey's critique: Right to city lacks inherent meaning
- Can be filled with progressive or neoliberal content
- Requires constant struggle over definition

### 3. Legalism vs. Direct Action
- Legal routes (referendums, constitutional challenges) vs. occupation/blockade
- Berlin referendum non-binding; requires legislative action
- Abahlali faces both legal victories and violent repression

4. Climate justice intersections with housing movements
5. Housing financialization's impact on right-to-city organizing

### Emerging Trends:
1. Digital Right to the City (Shaw & Graham, 2017)
2. Climate emergency framings in housing politics

---

## Conclusion

The Right to the City has evolved from Lefebvre's 1968 philosophical intervention into a global organizing framework spanning anti-eviction direct action, constitutional litigation, referendum campaigns, and UN policy. The concept's power lies in its flexibility—its ability to connect local housing struggles to broader questions of who shapes urban life and for whom.

The hard data reveals significant wins: over a million Berliners voting for expropriation, thousands of Spanish evictions stopped, South African slum legislation struck down, CLTs expanding across continents. Yet tensions persist between radical transformation and incremental reform, between legal strategies and direct action, between local specificity and global solidarity.

As David Harvey noted, the right to the city remains an "empty signifier"—its meaning continuously contested through struggle. The movements documented here represent ongoing attempts to fill that signifier with content: housing as commons rather than commodity, cities shaped by inhabitants rather than capital, urban life as collective oeuvre rather than exclusive good.
