# Stream Daylighting & Urban Pollinators — Direct Research Feb 20

## Stream/River Daylighting 2025

**The Trend (CityChangers Jan 2025):**
- "For decades, we've been building over rivers"
- "Now we understand their benefits"
- Cities daylighting (uncovering) urban waterways

**Smithsonian:**
- "Daylighting Buried Waterways Is Revitalizing Cities Across America"
- "Exhuming creeks and streams once covered to control floodwater"
- "Bringing life back in the process"

**Benefits (Princeton Hydro Dec 2024):**
- **Flood Mitigation:** Daylighted streams absorb stormwater more effectively
- Reduces urban flooding during heavy rain
- Natural flood control restored

**EU Ambitions (Interreg Europe):**
- 2030 target: restore 25,000+ km of free-flowing rivers
- Shift transport to inland waterways
- Part of broader water strategy

**The Metropole (April 2025):**
- "Forgotten Urban Currents"
- "Subterranean Rivers Shaping Modern Cities"
- Urban renewal + environmental benefits
- Restoring natural waterways

**Developing Country Context (IWA Jan 2025):**
- "Assessing restoration criteria for urban canal daylighting"
- Feasibility studies for buried canal resurrection
- Applicable globally

**Key Framing:** Buried streams are zombie rivers — daylighting brings them back to life.

## Urban Pollinators 2025

**The Crisis (Sheffield University):**
- "Urbanisation linked to 43% drop in pollinating insects"
- Nocturnal moths, hoverflies, bees declining
- Cities expanding = habitat loss

**Research Scale (Ollerton Feb 2025):**
- New study on "how urban spaces support pollinators"
- Bees vital for pollination
- Supporting natural ecosystems AND food supply
- Global decline documented

**Urban Solutions (BES Journals 2025 - 11 citations):**
- "From cities to refuges for pollinators"
- Adequate nutrition and nesting substrates needed
- Valorising urban green spaces
- Framework for enhancing pollinator habitats

**Multi-City Study (Royal Society):**
- Leeds, Leicester, Sheffield
- Comparing diurnal and nocturnal pollinators
- How urban landscape features affect abundance/diversity
- Bees, hoverflies, moths

**EEA (Europe):**
- "Protecting and restoring Europe's wild pollinators"
- Most important: wild bees, hoverflies, butterflies, moths
- Some beetles, wasps, flies also contribute

**Action Framework:**
- Engage society with dedicated policies
- Map pollinators for area prioritization
- Educational campaigns
- Citizen science involvement
- Counteract unwillingness

**Key Framing:** Cities can be pollinator refuges if designed right — bees make food possible.

## Synthesis: Water + Life for Living Cities

| Element | Current State | Living City |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Streams | Buried, piped | Daylighted, flowing |
| Pollinators | 43% decline | Habitat refuges |
| Urban Nature | Fragmented | Connected, thriving |

**Living City Design:**

1. **Stream Daylighting:**
   - Uncover all buried waterways
   - Restore natural flows
   - Create riparian corridors
   - Flood mitigation through nature
   - Public access to water

2. **Pollinator Habitat:**
   - Native flowering plants throughout
   - Nesting substrates provided
   - No pesticides
   - Night-friendly lighting (for moths)
   - Citizen science monitoring

3. **Water + Pollinators Connection:**
   - Riparian zones = pollinator corridors
   - Wet meadows for diverse habitat
   - Stream edges as foraging areas
   - Integrated blue-green infrastructure

**Living City Targets:**
- Zero buried streams
- Pollinator abundance equal to or exceeding rural areas
- Every resident within 100m of water feature

**Metric:**
- km of daylighted waterways
- Pollinator species count
- Pollinator abundance index
