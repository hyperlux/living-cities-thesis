# Community Land Trust Innovations 2024-2026

## Research Summary

This document synthesizes contemporary CLT innovations across four key dimensions: production hybrid models, financing innovations, international expansion, and intersections with data cooperatives. Research conducted February 2026.

## 1. CLT + Production Hybrid Models

### Agricultural CLT Models

**Agrarian Trust & Agrarian Commons Network**
- National land trust model specifically designed for farmland stewardship
- Addresses the critical challenge: 400 million acres (40%+ of US farmland) will change hands in 15 years as average farmer age approaches 60
- Focuses on land access for next-generation farmers, particularly farmers of color and regenerative agriculture practitioners
- Uses "Agrarian Commons" structure: community-owned land with long-term, secure tenure for farmers
- Key innovation: separates land ownership from farming operation, similar to housing CLT model

**Food Production Integration**
- Grounded Solutions Network documents CLTs developing "rural and urban agriculture projects" alongside housing
- RUSS (Rural Urban Synthesis Society) Church Grove project in London integrates edible gardens into housing design
- CLT residents collectively manage food production spaces as community assets

### Commercial/Mixed-Use Hybrids

**Commercial Corridor CLTs (New York City)**
- East New York CLT organizes for "neighborhood control" including commercial spaces
- CLTs increasingly steward "storefronts for locally owned small businesses, accessible waterfront and green spaces, and community and cultural hubs"
- San Francisco CLT acquisition at 3235 16th St. includes ground-floor commercial space (Barnets Salon)

**Production-Oriented Applications**
- International Center for CLT Innovation notes CLTs "can be used more widely to secure reliable, durable access to food production sites"
- Artist live-work housing: Laguna Beach CLT developing affordable artist production/living spaces (2025)

### Self-Build + Production Models

**London RUSS Church Grove Project (2024)**
- 36 affordable-in-perpetuity homes as London's largest community-led self-build housing project
- Residents directly involved in construction—some installed own kitchens, partition walls, plumbing
- Community hub, shared laundry, guest room managed collectively
- Model combines housing with community production capacity (skill-sharing, tool-sharing)

## 4. CLT + Data Cooperative Experiments

### Direct Intersections (Emerging)

**No documented CLT-specific data cooperative hybrids found in research.**

However, several adjacent developments suggest potential convergence:

### Data Commons Cooperative
- Solidarity economy data infrastructure organization
- Powers "democratic flows of data within cooperative and solidarity economy"
- Member-owned structure mirrors CLT governance
- Could theoretically serve CLT networks for property data, member info, impact measurement

### Platform Cooperativism + Housing Intersections
- Platform Cooperativism Consortium documents cooperative digital platforms
- Emerging interest in "housing" category within platform coop movement
- Democratic governance of platforms mirrors CLT board structures

### Data Dignity Frameworks (RadicalxChange)
- "People should be able to exert democratic collective bargaining power over their data"
- Data trusts concept parallels land trust structure
- Tools emerging: Ocean Protocol, OpenMined, Pool data unions
- Theoretical alignment: "data dignity" = "land dignity"

### Potential Hybrid Applications

**Urban Planning Data Commons**
- CLTs could serve as trustees for neighborhood-level data
- Property values, displacement risk indicators, demographic data
- Community-controlled alternative to predatory data harvesting by speculators

**Resident Data Cooperatives**
- CLT residents could collectively bargain over their housing data
- Energy usage, maintenance needs, community needs assessments
- Data could be controlled democratically rather than extracted by landlords

**CLT Network Data Infrastructure**
- Grounded Solutions Network 2022 Census demonstrates data collection capacity
- Shared data platform for CLT performance metrics, best practices
- Could evolve into cooperative data governance structure
