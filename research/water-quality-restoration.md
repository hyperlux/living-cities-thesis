## Executive Summary

Urban river restoration has emerged as one of the most significant environmental success stories of the past 50 years. From the Thames—once declared "biologically dead" in the 1950s—to Singapore's transformed waterways, cities worldwide have demonstrated that even severely degraded urban rivers can be revitalized. This document compiles hard data on pollution levels, restoration investments, and ecosystem outcomes across major global case studies.

## 1. River Thames, London (UK)

### Historical Context: The Great Stink (1858)

The Thames represents the world's longest-running urban river restoration project. The crisis point came during the "Great Stink" of July-August 1858, when:

- Temperatures reached 34-36°C (93-97°F) in shade, up to 48°C (118°F) in sun
- Untreated human waste and industrial effluent accumulated on riverbanks
- Parliament was forced to soak curtains in chloride of lime to mask odors
- Three cholera outbreaks (1831: 6,536 deaths; 1848-49: 14,137 deaths; 1853-54: 10,738 deaths)

### Joseph Bazalgette's Intervention (1859-1875)

- Designed interconnected sewer system moving effluent eastward
- High-, mid-, and low-level sewer systems on both Northern and Southern banks
- Construction of Victoria, Chelsea, and Albert Embankments
- Cost: £2.4-5.4 million (contemporary estimates)
- **Legacy:** System still operates in 2025, serving 9+ million people

### Modern Water Quality Data

**Pre-1960s Crisis:**
- Thames declared "biologically dead" in 1957
- Fish species reduced to **3** in London stretch
- 39 million cubic meters (39 million tonnes) of combined sewage overflow annually into tidal Thames
- 57 combined sewer overflows (CSOs) discharging raw sewage

**Recovery (2000s-present):**
- Fish species near Paris rebounded from **3 to 32 species** by early 2020s
- Atlantic salmon returned to Thames in **2009** (absent since 19th century)
- Combined sewer overflow previously occurred more than **once per week**
- As little as **2mm of rainfall** could trigger discharge

### Thames Tideway Tunnel (2016-2025)

## 2. River Seine, Paris (France)

### Historical Pollution Context

The Seine has faced concentrated pollution from:
- Heavy industrial activity
- Agricultural runoff (78% of basin is cultivated land)
- Urban sewage from Paris (18,457 people/km² in 2001 vs 6,825/km² historically)
- Low dilution capacity compared to other European rivers

**Pre-restoration conditions:**
- Fish species reduced to **2 species**
- Swimming banned since **1923** (100-year prohibition)
- Major laws passed: 1898, 1964, 1996, 2006

### "Swimming Plan" Investment (2018-2025)

| Investment | Amount |
|------------|--------|
| Total cleanup program | **€1.4 billion ($1.55 billion)** |
| Rainwater storage basin | Major infrastructure component |

**Key interventions:**
- Construction of basin to store rainwater, slowly released to prevent overflow
- Extension of wastewater treatment plant capacity
- Reduction of organic carbon, phosphorus, and ammonium

### Water Quality Metrics

**Before restoration:**
- E. coli levels often **far exceeded safe swimming thresholds**
- Frequent phytoplankton blooms
- 60% of urban sewage untreated by 1970

**After restoration (2020s):**
- Fish species surged from **2 to over 30**
- Mayor Anne Hidalgo swam in Seine: **17 July 2024**
- River reopened for swimming: **July 2025** (first time in ~100 years)

### 2024 Paris Olympics Water Quality

- Triathlon initially postponed due to water quality (rainstorm during opening ceremony drove untreated water back into Seine)
- Event proceeded following day after testing confirmed sufficient quality
- Demonstrated ongoing vulnerability to combined sewer overflow during rain events

## 3. Los Angeles River (USA)

### Pre-Restoration Conditions

The LA River underwent dramatic transformation in the early 20th century:

- Originally: free-flowing alluvial river with floodplains
- Frequent flooding destroyed farmland, houses, killed livestock
- Primary water source for Los Angeles until LA Aqueduct (1913)
- Used as open sewer—waste, dead animals, sewage dumped directly

**Channelization (1938-ongoing):**
- After devastating floods, Army Corps of Engineers encased river in concrete
- 51-mile concrete channel fixed the river's course
- Severely degraded ecological function
- Eliminated natural absorption, preventing groundwater recharge

### Current Status & Pollution

| Metric | Data |
|--------|------|
| Length | 51 miles (82 km) |
| Watershed | 827 sq mi (2,140 km²) |
| Average flow | 226 cu ft/s (6.4 m³/s) |
| Maximum flood flow | 129,000 cu ft/s (3,700 m³/s) |
| Primary pollutants | Agricultural runoff, urban runoff |

**Water Sources:**
- Rainwater and snowmelt (winter/spring)
- Donald C. Tillman Water Reclamation Plant (summer/fall)
- Urban discharge
- One of few low-elevation perennial rivers in Southern California

### Restoration Efforts

**Glendale Narrows:** One section retains natural riverbed (not fully concreted), providing model for restoration.

**Key challenge:** Balancing flood control with ecological restoration in highly urbanized watershed.

### Indigenous & Historical Significance

- Tongva people called it Paayme Paxaayt ("West River")
- At least **45 Tongva villages** existed near the river
- Concentrated in San Fernando Valley and Elysian Valley
