# New City Projects: Reality vs. Hype

## Research Summary for Living Cities Thesis

**Last Updated:** February 2026  
**Projects Analyzed:** Telosa, Culdesac Tempe, NEOM, Toyota Woven City

---

## Executive Summary

The four projects represent vastly different approaches to "building the future":
- **Culdesac Tempe** - Small-scale, operational, market-driven ✅
- **Toyota Woven City** - Corporate R&D lab, incremental, modest scope ✅
- **Telosa** - Utopian vision, pre-construction, high hype ⚠️
- **NEOM** - Megaproject hubris, massive failures, human rights disaster ❌

**Key insight:** The projects that work are small, incremental, and market-tested. The ones that fail are top-down, grandiose, and disconnected from economic reality.

## 1. CULDESAC TEMPE 🟢 (What's Actually Working)

### Status: OPERATIONAL
- **Location:** Tempe, Arizona (Phoenix metro)
- **Scale:** 16 acres, 636 units, ~1,000 residents at capacity
- **Cost:** $140 million
- **Founded:** 2019 (construction), residents moving in 2023+

### What They Got Right

**1. Car-Free by Design, Not Ideology**
Culdesac doesn't moralize about cars—they make car-free living *convenient*:
- Unlimited free metro rides for residents
- Waymo autonomous vehicle access
- Bird scooters on-site
- Envoy carshare starting at $7/hour
- 1,000+ bike parking spots
- 21 local businesses within walking distance

**2. Real Economics**
- Market-rate apartments with transportation perks valued at $1,000s/year
- Partnership model with mobility companies (not subsidies)
- Retail ground floors with local businesses
- Conventional real estate financing

**3. Density Done Right**
- 50+ courtyards and BBQ areas
- 2+ miles of bike/foot paths
- 20+ apartment floor plans
- 2 dog parks
- Intentional community spaces

### What's Working
- **Resident demand is real** - waitlists and high occupancy
- **Retail program** - award-winning local businesses thriving
- **Replicability** - Culdesac is actively seeking second location

### Lessons for Living Cities
1. **Start with mobility partnerships, not infrastructure** - Don't build rail; partner with existing transit
2. **Market-rate housing can be car-free** - No need for subsidy if design eliminates car costs
3. **16 acres is enough** - You don't need to build a city, just a neighborhood
4. **Ground-floor retail creates community** - Not just residential towers
5. **Phoenix (sprawl capital!) proved the model** - If it works there, it works anywhere

## 2. TOYOTA WOVEN CITY 🟢 (Corporate Prototype)

### Status: UNDER CONSTRUCTION / EARLY RESIDENTS
- **Location:** Susono, Japan (base of Mt. Fuji)
- **Scale:** 175 acres (former Toyota factory site)
- **Purpose:** Living laboratory for mobility R&D
- **Architect:** Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG)
- **Timeline:** Construction began 2021, first residents ~2024-2025

### Approach

**1. "Test Course for Mobility"**
Toyota explicitly calls it a *test course*, not a utopia:
- Testing autonomous vehicles
- Hydrogen fuel cell infrastructure
- Smart home technologies
- AI/robotics integration
- Energy management systems

**2. Controlled Environment**
- Residents are Toyota employees, researchers, and families
- Not a real city—a research facility disguised as one
- ~2,000 initial residents (eventually ~350 employees + families)
- Three types of streets: fast (autonomous), slow (personal mobility), pedestrian-only

**3. Corporate Purpose**
- Data collection on living patterns
- Real-world testing vs. simulations
- Brand/PR for Toyota's "mobility company" pivot

### What's Working
- **Modest ambitions** - Not trying to reinvent society
- **Funded by Toyota's balance sheet** - No speculative financing
- **Clear business purpose** - R&D, not utopia
- **Japanese execution culture** - Actually building, not just rendering

### Limitations
- Not replicable by cities/developers
- Not testing affordability or market dynamics
- Selection bias in residents (Toyota employees)
- May not translate to real urban conditions

### Lessons for Living Cities
1. **Frame it as R&D, not revolution** - Easier to fund, execute, iterate
2. **Corporate backing beats VC timelines** - Patient capital matters
3. **Start with employees/believers** - First residents need to be invested
4. **Integrate technology testing with actual living** - Not just smart home demos

## 3. TELOSA ⚠️ (Utopian Vaporware)

### Status: PRE-CONSTRUCTION (NO SITE SELECTED)
- **Founder:** Marc Lore (Jet.com, Walmart e-commerce)
- **Proposed Scale:** 5 million population, 240 sq mi
- **Estimated Cost:** $400 billion
- **Architect:** Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG)
- **Location:** TBD (Utah, Idaho, Nevada, Arizona, Texas, or Appalachia)
- **Timeline:** First 50,000 residents by ~2030s (per original plans)

### The Vision

**"Equitism" Economic Model**
Based on Georgist economics (Henry George, *Progress and Poverty* 1879):
- Community endowment owns all land
- Residents can build/own structures
- Land appreciation shared communally
- Fund social services through land value capture

**Urban Design**
- 15-minute city (walkable to all services)
- No fossil fuel vehicles
- Autonomous electric vehicles
- Aeroponic farms in central tower
- High-density mixed-use

### Red Flags

**1. No Location After 4+ Years**
- Announced September 2021
- As of 2026, still "scouting" for cheap desert land
- Location is the *first* decision for a city—they haven't made it

**2. "Equitism" Is Untested at Scale**
- Georgist land value tax has never been implemented for a whole city
- Requires residents to give up land ownership (will Americans do this?)
- Legal complexity of endowment owning all land

**3. $400B Is Not Serious Money**
- Marc Lore is worth ~$3-4B
- $400B is 100x his net worth
- No disclosed investors or funding mechanism
- For comparison: NEOM has $500B committed from Saudi government and is still failing

**4. Billionaire Utopia Track Record**
- **Fordlandia** (Ford) - abandoned
- **Akon City** (Senegal) - vaporware
- **Bitcoin City** (El Salvador) - not built
- **Próspera** (Honduras) - legal/political battles

### What's Happening
- Beautiful BIG renderings
- Community forums and webinars
- Lots of press coverage
- **No ground broken, no site selected, no investors disclosed**

### Lessons for Living Cities
1. **Beware renderings without locations** - The vision is the easy part
2. **Georgist economics interesting but unproven** - Test at small scale first
3. **Billionaire founders often lose interest** - Lore's attention is split (also owns Minnesota Timberwolves/Lynx)
4. **Desert cities face water constraints** - Especially in climate change era
5. **"Utopia" framing attracts criticism** - Culdesac succeeded by being boring and practical

## 4. NEOM ❌ (Cautionary Tale)

### Status: DRAMATICALLY SCALED BACK / UNDER CRISIS
- **Location:** Tabuk Province, Saudi Arabia
- **Original Scale:** 26,500 km² (size of Albania)
- **Original Cost:** $1.6 trillion → Now estimated **$8.8+ trillion**
- **Sponsor:** Saudi Public Investment Fund / Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman
- **CEO:** Nadhmi Al-Nasr (removed October 2024), replaced by Aimen Al-Mudaifer

### What Was Promised

**The Line**
- 170km linear city, 500m tall, 200m wide
- 9 million residents
- Zero cars, zero carbon
- Mirror glass exterior in the desert

**Other Components**
- Oxagon (floating industrial octagon)
- Trojena (ski resort in Arabian desert)
- Sindalah (luxury island resort)
- Aquellum (underground "inverted skyscraper")
- Plus ~15 other announced zones

### What Actually Happened

**1. Massive Scale Back (2024-2025)**
- The Line now targeting 2.4km by 2030 (1.4% of original length)
- Population target cut from 9M to 300,000
- Internal audit found "deliberate manipulation" by managers
- Wall Street Journal reports extensive cost overruns and delays
- No mention of NEOM in Saudi Arabia's 2026 pre-budget statement
- New contracts have "dried up" as of 2025

**2. Sindalah Opening Fiasco**
- Grand opening party held October 2024
- As of March 2025: **still closed to the public**
- Delivered 3 years late at 3x original cost
- Fate "uncertain"

**3. Human Rights Catastrophe**
- ~21,000 foreign worker deaths reported since 2017
- 100,000 workers reported "missing"
- Workers describe 16-hour days, 14 consecutive days, 50°C heat
- Members of Howeitat tribe forcibly evicted
- Abdul Rahim al-Huwaiti killed by Saudi forces for resisting eviction
- Three tribe members sentenced to death for resisting

**4. Work Culture Dysfunction**
- Former employees compare to "Emperor's New Clothes"
- CEO Nasr: "I drive everybody like a slave, when they drop down dead, I celebrate."
- Dissent punished; unrealistic demands from MBS ignored or punished when raised

### Why It Failed

1. **Top-down autocratic planning** - No market testing, no iteration
2. **Physics-defying plans** - A 170km x 500m structure is structurally implausible
3. **Zero accountability** - "Deliberate manipulation" by managers went unchecked
4. **Slave labor mindset** - Treating workers as disposable leads to dysfunction
5. **PR over reality** - More money spent on marketing than engineering feasibility
6. **Single patron dependency** - MBS's whims drive everything
7. **No organic demand** - Who wants to live in a 500m tall mirror in the desert?

### Lessons for Living Cities
1. **Megaprojects fail; start small** - 16-acre Culdesac > 26,500 km² NEOM
2. **Top-down planning is fragile** - Markets and democracy are error-correcting
3. **Beware authoritarian efficiency** - Speed hides catastrophic mistakes
4. **Human rights are structural** - Abuse workers = dysfunction in everything
5. **Renderings lie** - Beautiful CGI ≠ engineering feasibility
6. **Single-patron projects are high-risk** - What happens when MBS loses interest?
7. **Desert cities have hard limits** - Water, heat, remoteness

## Synthesis: What Works, What Doesn't

### WORKS ✅

| Factor | Culdesac | Woven City |
|--------|----------|------------|
| Scale | 16 acres | 175 acres |
| Funding | Private equity, market-rate | Corporate balance sheet |
| Residents | Market demand | Employee selection |
| Purpose | Housing + community | R&D living lab |
| Timeline | Incremental | Phased |
| Governance | Normal city (Tempe) | Corporate |

### DOESN'T WORK ❌

| Factor | Telosa | NEOM |
|--------|--------|------|
| Scale | 240 sq mi / 5M people | 26,500 km² / 9M people |
| Funding | TBD (none disclosed) | $500B+ sovereign |
| Residents | TBD | Forced relocation |
| Purpose | Utopia / "equitism" | MBS vanity |
| Timeline | "By 2050" | "By 2030" (failed) |
| Governance | New experimental model | Autocratic |

### Key Principles for Living Cities

1. **Start with a neighborhood, not a city**
   - Culdesac: 16 acres, 1,000 people
   - Prove the model, then expand

2. **Use market mechanisms**
   - Residents should *choose* to live there
   - Market-rate housing tests real demand

3. **Partner, don't build infrastructure**
   - Culdesac partners with metro, Waymo, Bird
   - Don't build your own transit system

4. **Corporate backing beats sovereign wealth**
   - Toyota's patient capital > Saudi PIF's political capital
   - Accountability to shareholders > accountability to one prince

5. **Test economic innovations at small scale**
   - Georgist land tax (Telosa) is interesting
   - Test in one neighborhood before 5M population

6. **Integrate with existing cities**
   - Culdesac is in Tempe, near light rail
   - Woven City uses Toyota's existing supply chains
   - NEOM/Telosa require building everything from scratch

7. **Boring beats utopian**
   - "Car-free apartments in Tempe" < "City of the Future"
   - But one is real and one is renderings

8. **Respect existing residents**
   - NEOM's forced relocations = moral and practical failure
   - Cities are people, not plans

## Implications for Living Cities Thesis

### The "Living City" Should Be:

1. **A methodology, not a megaproject**
   - Set of principles applicable to existing neighborhoods
   - Not a greenfield utopia

2. **Incremental and testable**
   - Start with one block, then neighborhood
   - Measure outcomes, iterate

3. **Market-compatible**
   - Real estate economics that work without subsidies
   - Transportation partnerships that scale

4. **Integrated with existing fabric**
   - Infill and retrofit, not desert cities
   - Use existing transit, utilities, governance

5. **Human rights as foundation**
   - Democratic participation
   - No displacement without consent
   - Worker protections

### What to Avoid:

- **"$400B city of the future" framing**
- **Novel governance structures at city scale**
- **Greenfield sites requiring all-new infrastructure**
- **Single-patron funding models**
- **Renderings without construction**
- **5-50 year timelines before validation**

### Next Research Steps:

1. Study **Strong Towns** incremental urbanism approach
2. Research **Vienna social housing** (market-compatible density)
3. Analyze **Japanese railway-integrated development** (proven model)
4. Investigate **Barcelona superblocks** (retrofit existing cities)
5. Compare **Singapore HDB** (successful state-led, but different context)
