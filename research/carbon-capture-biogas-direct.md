# Carbon Capture & Biogas Systems — Direct Research Feb 20

## Direct Air Capture (DAC) 2025

**Market Status (CDR.fyi Oct 2025):**
- Three companies dominate: 1PointFive, Climeworks, Heirloom
- Account for 80% of total DAC credits sold

**Climeworks — Global Leader:**
- First commercial DAC and storage facilities
- Only independently certified AAA-rated projects
- 2 generations of technology deployed
- 3rd generation in large-scale validation since 2024

**Technology:**
- Can be deployed anywhere with low-carbon energy
- Several projects globally deployed
- More under development

**Diversification:**
- Climeworks Solutions division launched
- Aggregates and verifies carbon-removal credits
- Sources: enhanced rock weathering, biochar, afforestation
- Beyond DAC to diversified carbon solutions

**Key Challenge:** Energy-intensive; requires low-carbon energy source to be net-negative

## Synthesis: Carbon Negative Living Cities

**Carbon Balance:**

| Activity | Emissions | Capture/Offset |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| Construction | Embodied carbon | Mass timber sequestration |
| Energy | Minimal (passive house) | Community solar/biogas |
| Food | Local production | Regenerative agriculture |
| Waste | None (circular) | Biogas from organics |
| Air | — | DAC where affordable |

**Biogas Integration for Living Cities:**

1. **Inputs:** Food waste, agricultural residue, sewage
2. **Process:** Anaerobic digestion
3. **Outputs:** 
   - Biogas (cooking, heating, electricity)
   - Digestate (fertilizer for food production)

**DAC Consideration:**
- High cost currently
- May become viable at scale
- Requires abundant clean energy
- Could be part of long-term carbon strategy

**Design Principle:** Living Cities should:
- Achieve net-zero emissions through efficiency
- Generate biogas from all organic waste
- Use digestate for regenerative agriculture
- Consider DAC as costs decline

**Metric:**
- Annual carbon balance (emissions vs sequestration)
- % of waste converted to biogas
- Soil carbon increase rate
