# Living Cities: Organ Diagnostic Scorecards & Attractor Design Templates

**The Actionable Toolkit for Urban Organism Health**

*A companion document to LIVING CITIES: Biology, Abundance & Meaning in the Post-Labor Age*

---

## How to Use This Toolkit

This document provides practical diagnostic tools for assessing and improving the health of your city as a living organism. Each organ scorecard includes:

1. **Health Indicators** — Quantifiable metrics with clear thresholds
2. **Data Sources** — Where to find the numbers
3. **Warning Signs** — Early symptoms of organ failure
4. **Attractor Design Patterns** — Governance structures that create health

**For Mayors and City Leaders:** Start with the Master Dashboard (Section 10). Identify your weakest organs. Use individual scorecards to diagnose specific issues and design interventions.

**For Civic Organizers:** Use scorecards to identify leverage points and build coalitions around measurable goals.

**For Researchers and Planners:** Use the attractor design worksheet (Section 11) to prototype new governance structures.

# PART ONE: THE NINE ORGAN SCORECARDS

---

## 1. NOURISHMENT ORGAN
### Food Systems Diagnostic Scorecard

**Biological Principle:** Every cell needs nutrients delivered reliably. The nourishment organ ensures all parts of the organism receive sustenance without toxicity or deprivation.

**Post-Labor Function:** When work no longer guarantees food access, the nourishment organ ensures universal nutrition through ownership mechanisms rather than employment-based purchasing power.

- Illegal dumping increasing
- Combined sewer overflows during rain events
- Environmental justice complaints increasing

**Mid Stage:**
- Landfill capacity running out
- Drinking water contamination events
- Brownfields spreading, not shrinking
- Export of waste to poor communities increasing

**Late Stage:**
- Public health crisis from environmental exposure
- No recycling markets
- Superfund sites affecting drinking water
- Environmental refugees within city

### Attractor Design Patterns

**Pattern 1: Circular Economy Exchange**
- **Structure:** Platform matching waste producers with input seekers; industrial symbiosis
- **Incentive Alignment:** Waste becomes revenue; virgin material costs more than recycled
- **Anti-Capture Mechanism:** Open participation; material tracking; verified circular claims
- **Existing Models:** Kalundborg (Denmark), industrial symbiosis networks

**Pattern 2: Extended Producer Responsibility Mandate**
- **Structure:** Producers responsible for end-of-life management of products
- **Incentive Alignment:** Design for recyclability becomes profitable; planned obsolescence penalized
- **Anti-Capture Mechanism:** Independent verification; escalating fees for non-compliance
- **Existing Models:** EU packaging directive, BC EPR programs

**Pattern 3: Community Composting Cooperative**
- **Structure:** Neighborhood-scale composting with member participation and governance
- **Incentive Alignment:** Members get compost; surplus sold; keeps organics local
- **Anti-Capture Mechanism:** Membership caps; excess capacity funds new sites
- **Existing Models:** BIG Reuse (NYC), community composting networks

**Pattern 4: Regeneration Targeting Authority**
- **Structure:** Sets waste reduction and remediation targets; posts escrowed bounties
- **Incentive Alignment:** Innovators earn rewards for verified waste reduction
- **Anti-Capture Mechanism:** Lifecycle verification; third-party audits
- **Target Example:** "$25M escrowed. Released when per-capita waste drops 50% AND all brownfields enter remediation."

## 9. MEANING INFRASTRUCTURE
### The Ninth Pillar Diagnostic Scorecard

**Biological Principle:** The integrative system—what makes an organism more than the sum of its parts. Purpose, coherence, identity. Without meaning, the organs function but the organism doesn't thrive.

**Post-Labor Function:** When work no longer provides identity, structure, and purpose, meaning must come from other sources: contribution, connection, creativity, and participation in something larger.

### Health Indicators

| Indicator | 🟢 GREEN (Healthy) | 🟡 YELLOW (Stressed) | 🔴 RED (Failing) |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **1. Loneliness Rate** | <20% report chronic loneliness | 20-35% lonely | >35% lonely |
| **2. Sense of Belonging** | >70% feel they belong in their neighborhood | 50-70% belong | <50% belong |
| **3. Purpose/Meaning** | >65% report sense of purpose in life | 45-65% with purpose | <45% with purpose |
| **4. Third Place Density** | >5 non-commercial gathering places per 1,000 population | 2-5 per 1,000 | <2 per 1,000 |
| **5. Volunteer/Contribution Rate** | >30% volunteered in past year | 15-30% volunteered | <15% volunteered |
| **6. Social Trust** | >50% say "most people can be trusted" | 30-50% trust | <30% trust |
| **7. Deaths of Despair Rate** | <30 per 100,000 | 30-60 per 100,000 | >60 per 100,000 |

### Data Sources

| Indicator | Primary Source | Secondary Source | Update Frequency |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|------------------|
| Loneliness | UCLA Loneliness Scale surveys | Health department surveys | Annual |
| Belonging | Community surveys | Pew/Gallup trust surveys | Annual |
| Purpose/Meaning | Meaning in Life Questionnaire surveys | Mental health assessments | Annual |
| Third Places | Community space audit | Parks/library/community center inventory | Biennial |
| Volunteer Rate | Current Population Survey supplement | Nonprofit volunteer data | Annual |
| Social Trust | General Social Survey | World Values Survey | Biennial |
| Deaths of Despair | CDC WONDER database | State vital statistics | Annual |

### Warning Signs of Organ Failure

**Early Stage:**
- Religious attendance declining without secular replacement
- Community centers closing
- "Bowling alone" symptoms (declining civic associations)
- Mental health service demand increasing

**Mid Stage:**
- Rising deaths of despair (suicide, overdose, alcohol-related)
- Mass loneliness epidemic
- Extremist recruitment increasing
- Intergenerational disconnect

**Late Stage:**
- Social fabric collapse
- Mass nihilism or destructive ideologies
- No shared narrative or identity
- Life expectancy declining despite medical advances

---

### Attractor Design Patterns

**Pattern 1: Third Place Network**
- **Structure:** Publicly-funded non-commercial gathering spaces in every neighborhood
- **Incentive Alignment:** Community determines programming; attendance is the metric
- **Anti-Capture Mechanism:** Cannot be privatized; must be free to enter; community governance
- **Existing Models:** Oodi Library (Helsinki), Men's Sheds (Australia), Community centers (Japan)

**Pattern 2: Contribution Recognition System**
- **Structure:** Status currencies that recognize non-market contributions
- **Incentive Alignment:** Contribution visible and honored; not converted to money
- **Anti-Capture Mechanism:** Multiple recognition paths; community-defined value
- **Existing Models:** Timebanking, citizen science recognition, volunteer honors

**Pattern 3: Ritual Infrastructure**
- **Structure:** Secular rituals marking life transitions, seasons, community events
- **Incentive Alignment:** Participation creates belonging; rituals create meaning
- **Anti-Capture Mechanism:** Community ownership of ritual design; pluralistic options
- **Existing Models:** Secular weddings/funerals, community festivals, solidarity events

**Pattern 4: Meaning Weaving Cooperative**
- **Structure:** Member-governed organization creating narrative, identity, connection
- **Incentive Alignment:** Members define what meaningful life looks like; services support it
- **Anti-Capture Mechanism:** No single ideology dominates; pluralism required
- **Target Example:** Community-governed gathering spaces, storytelling circles, mentorship networks

**Pattern 5: Generosity Infrastructure**
- **Structure:** Systems that make giving easy, visible, and normal
- **Incentive Alignment:** Giving feels good; recognition without scorekeeping
- **Anti-Capture Mechanism:** Multiple pathways; cannot be hoarded; flows by design
- **Example:** Mutual aid networks, care circles, skill-sharing, time banks

| **RED (Critical)** | **IMMEDIATE PRIORITY** - Will cascade | URGENT - Address soon |
| **YELLOW (Stressed)** | WATCH CLOSELY - Prevention zone | MONITOR - May self-correct |
| **GREEN (Healthy)** | PROTECT - Maintain these | MAINTAIN - Continue practices |

**Triage Protocol:**
1. Identify all RED organs
2. Among RED organs, prioritize by interdependency (higher impact first)
3. Among YELLOW organs, prioritize those adjacent to RED organs
4. Protect GREEN organs from resource diversion

## 11. ATTRACTOR DESIGN WORKSHEET
### How to Design a New Attractor for Any Domain

**What is an Attractor?**

In complex systems, an attractor is a state toward which the system naturally evolves. In governance, attractors are the incentive structures, ownership patterns, and feedback loops that pull behavior toward certain outcomes.

**Design healthy attractors** = behaviors that serve the organism naturally emerge.
**Inherit unhealthy attractors** = constant struggle against the system's own dynamics.

---

### The Attractor Design Canvas

Use this worksheet when designing a new governance structure, ownership mechanism, or intervention.

```

---

#### SECTION 3: MECHANISM DESIGN

**3.1 What ownership structure will align incentives?**

- [ ] **Cooperative** - Members own and govern collectively
- [ ] **Community Land Trust** - Community owns land, individuals own improvements
- [ ] **Public Utility** - Government-owned with transparency requirements

- [ ] **Data Cooperative** - Producers own and govern their data collectively
- [ ] **Targeting Authority** - Sets goals, posts bounties, verifies outcomes
- [ ] **Hybrid** - Combination (describe): _______________________________

**3.2 What governance structure prevents capture?**

Anti-capture mechanisms to consider:

- [ ] **Rotating leadership** - Term limits, lottery selection
- [ ] **Sunset provisions** - Must be renewed or expires
- [ ] **Exit rights** - Members can leave with their stake
- [ ] **Transparency requirements** - All decisions/data public
- [ ] **Red-team bounties** - Pay for finding gaming/capture
- [ ] **Stakeholder representation** - Multiple constituencies at the table
- [ ] **Constitutional protections** - Core principles cannot be changed
- [ ] **Fork rights** - Community can split if captured
- [ ] **Other**: _____________________________________________

**3.3 What feedback loops create accountability?**

```

### The Questions That Matter

At every decision point, ask:

1. **Who owns it?** (Distributed ownership > concentrated)
2. **Who benefits?** (Residents > platforms > investors)
3. **Who decides?** (Democratic > technocratic > autocratic)
4. **Does it create flow?** (Circulation > accumulation)
5. **Does it build trust?** (Transparent > opaque)
6. **Does it serve meaning?** (Conditions for generous living > efficiency)

## APPENDIX B: GLOSSARY

**Attractor:** In complex systems, a state toward which the system naturally evolves. In governance, the incentive structures and feedback loops that pull behavior toward certain outcomes.

**Capture:** When a system meant to serve a broad public comes to serve a narrow interest (regulatory capture, platform capture, political capture).

**Circulation:** The flow of value through a system. Living systems require circulation; blocked flows cause death.

**Cooperative:** A member-owned and democratically governed organization, whether of workers, consumers, producers, or residents.

**Data Cooperative:** A member-owned organization that manages collective data, enables collective bargaining with data users, and distributes value back to member-producers.

**Living City:** An urban system that operates as an adaptive organism serving its residents, where the coordination layer is citizen-owned rather than platform-captured or state-controlled.

**Organ:** A functional subsystem of the city organism, analogous to biological organs (nourishment, metabolism, circulation, etc.).

**Post-Labor Economics:** Economic structures designed for a world where human labor is increasingly unnecessary for production, based on ownership rather than employment.

**Targeting Authority:** A body that defines measurable targets, posts escrowed bounties, and verifies outcomes—creating market incentives for solving specific problems.

**Third Place:** A social space separate from home (first place) and work (second place) where community happens—libraries, parks, cafes, community centers.

*"The systems we build—data cooperatives, targeting authorities, ownership mechanisms—exist for one purpose: creating conditions for quiet kindness. Not dramatic heroism. Not publicized philanthropy. Quiet kindness. The neighbor who watches your kids without keeping score. The stranger who helps with groceries and walks away before being thanked."*

*— Living Cities Thesis, §3.7*
