## Overview

This thesis presents a complete framework for building "Living Cities": urban systems that operate as adaptive organisms serving their residents, rather than extraction engines draining value from them.

**The Core Insight:** The same technology that enables platform capture in cities can enable citizen-owned abundance. The difference is governance.

## Key Themes

- **Post-Labor Economics**: Ownership mechanisms for an automated economy
- **Data Cooperatives**: Resident-owned data with dividends from use
- **Anti-Capture Mechanisms**: Constitutional protections against platform lock-in
- **Six-Layer Stack**: Physical → Digital → Data → Governance → Economic → Purpose

## The Vision

> Living cities aren't built by vendors. They're grown by residents who govern what serves them. The scaffolding is what we build. The cathedral - quiet kindness, generous living - is what grows inside.
