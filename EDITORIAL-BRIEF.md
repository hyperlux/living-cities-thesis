# KOROVED Editorial Brief: The Definitive Masterpiece

**Target:** 150,000–200,000 words (~400–550 printed pages)  
**Ambition:** The foundational text for the post-labor urban movement for the next 50 years

---

## Final Title

# Living Cities: Biology, Abundance & Meaning in the Post-Labor Age

---

## Unifying Thesis

> "The Living City is a post-labor urban organism — a coherent collective that grows, metabolizes abundance, and generates meaning through eight biological organs plus a ninth pillar of human aspiration, held together by attractors instead of rules."

*Must appear early and echo throughout.*

## Source Materials (Use ALL)

1. **Latest Live Version** (primary): https://hyperlux.github.io/living-cities-thesis/#/
2. **Original Web Manifesto** (soul & biology): https://hyperlux.github.io/the-living-city/#/THE-LIVING-CITY
3. **79-page Post-Labor PDF** (rigor, politics, institutions)

## Non-Negotiable Requirements

- **One breathing organism** — biology + institutional/post-labor systems must be indistinguishable
- **Every chapter must answer:** "How does this organ/system deliver temporal structure, status, connection, and meaning without work?"
- **Attractor logic operationalized** with concrete "how-to" playbooks
- **Illustrated:** 1 full-page diagram per organ + mini-scorecards + photo essay inserts
- **Tone:** Manifesto fire + rigorous clarity + honest vulnerability + poetic biology. Urgent but never utopian.
- **Audience:** Mayors, architects, 25-year-olds, policymakers, bioregional organizers, Auroville-style communities

- Global South & Decolonial Pathways (Lagos, Medellín, kampungs, etc.)

### Part V: Risks, Evolution & Legacy (~25k words)

- Red-team "What Could Go Wrong" with antifragile countermeasures

## Quality Standards

- Feel like one breathing organism, not stitched documents
- Biology (web) + Institutional/Post-Labor systems (PDF) + Latest synthesis = indistinguishable
- Urgent but never utopian
- Actionable for a mayor on Monday morning AND inspiring for a 25-year-old wondering what life is for
