## Introduction: Blood Supply for the Urban Body

> *"Show me your budget and I'll tell you what you value."*
> — Joe Biden (paraphrasing the principle)

Every living organism needs circulation. Blood carries oxygen, nutrients, and waste through the body. Block the flow, and organs die. Restrict circulation to certain organs, and the body becomes diseased. Hoard blood in one location, and the system collapses.

**The central question of this chapter is not "Where does the money come from?" but rather "Where does the money flow?"**

Current urban finance is characterized by extraction. Value flows out—to distant shareholders, to speculative holders, to platforms that capture data without compensation. Living city finance is characterized by circulation. Value flows through—captured where created, distributed to those who create it, reinvested in the systems that generate more.

This is not a question of more or less government. Singapore has high government involvement and successful urban finance. Houston has low government involvement and dysfunctional urban finance. Both extract from residents; neither distributes ownership. The ownership structure matters more than the public-private mix.

Cities are no different. Money is the blood of the urban organism. It must circulate—flowing through housing, transit, energy, food systems, healthcare, education—reaching every cell, every neighborhood, every resident. When money hoards in real estate speculation while transit starves, the city becomes sick. When finance flows only to luxury development while affordable housing withers, the organism develops necrosis.

This chapter addresses the fundamental question: **How do we fund the transition from machine cities to living cities without creating new forms of extraction, dependence, or debt?**

The answer is not more public spending. It is not privatization. It is not austerity. It is a fundamental redesign of how cities capture, circulate, and distribute value—treating finance as metabolic flow rather than extractive drain.

We will cover five interrelated systems:

1. **Land-Value Capture 2.0** — Reclaiming the value that public investment creates
2. **Abundance Dividends** — Universal ownership income from urban metabolism
3. **Citizen Investment Trusts** — Community ownership of urban infrastructure
4. **Global Coordination** — Wealth taxes, climate finance, and South-South flows
5. **Transition Financing** — How to fund the shift organ by organ

Each system is designed to work with the others. Together, they create a circulatory system that funds living cities while maintaining—and strengthening—citizen agency.

## 1. LAND-VALUE CAPTURE 2.0

### The Central Injustice

Here is a fact that should enrage every city finance officer:

**Public investment creates private land value. Private landowners capture that value. The public pays again.**

When a city builds a subway line, property values along the corridor increase 10-25%. When a city builds a park, surrounding land values rise 5-20%. When a city improves schools, neighborhood property values climb. When a city reduces crime, builds infrastructure, zones for development—every intervention that makes a location more desirable increases land values.

Who paid for these improvements? Taxpayers.

Who captures the value? Landowners.

Who pays again? Taxpayers—through higher rents, higher home prices, and the need to fund the next round of improvements.

This is the fundamental mechanism of urban wealth extraction. Public investment creates value. Private landowners capture it. The public is left with the bill but not the benefit.

**Estimated annual value:** In the United States alone, the annual increase in land values due to public investment and community development is estimated at $500-800 billion. Globally, the figure exceeds $3 trillion. This is value created by collective action, captured by individual landowners.

### The Georgist Insight

Henry George understood this in 1879. His solution: **tax land values, not labor or improvements.**

The logic is simple:
- Land value is created by the community (location, infrastructure, services)
- Labor and capital improvements are created by individuals
- Tax what the community creates; leave alone what individuals create

A land value tax (LVT) captures the value that public investment creates, returning it to the public. Unlike property taxes, which penalize improvement, LVT encourages development by taxing only the land itself.

**Example calculation:**
- A plot in downtown Manhattan: land value $50M, building value $20M
- Traditional property tax (2%): $1.4M annually (penalizes the $20M improvement)
- Land value tax (4%): $2M annually (captures land value, building untaxed)
- Result: Developer keeps full return on building investment; community captures location value

### Case Study: Harrisburg, Pennsylvania

Harrisburg provides the clearest American example of land value taxation working.

**Before (1980s):**
- City losing population
- Abandoned properties everywhere
- 4,200 vacant lots and structures
- Declining tax base, rising crime
- Near bankruptcy

**The intervention (1982-2003):**
- Implemented split-rate tax: higher rate on land, lower on improvements
- By 2003: land taxed at 6x the rate of buildings
- Reduced penalty for building/improving properties
- Increased cost of holding vacant land

**Results:**
- Vacant structures declined from 4,200 to fewer than 500
- Building permits increased dramatically
- Downtown revitalized without public subsidy
- Population stabilized
- Crime rates fell

**The mechanism:** When holding vacant land becomes expensive, owners either develop or sell. When improving buildings is tax-advantaged, investment follows. The split-rate tax created incentives for productive use without spending public money.

**Harrisburg's numbers (1982-2000):**
- Building permits: +$212 million in new construction
- Vacant structures: -4,000+
- Downtown businesses: +500%
- Public cost: Zero direct subsidy

### Case Study: Singapore

Singapore demonstrates land value capture at national scale.

**The foundation:**
- Government owns 90% of land
- Leases land to private developers (typically 99-year terms)
- Captures appreciation through lease renewal negotiations
- Returns value through the Housing Development Board (HDB)

**The mechanism:**
- When land value rises, the government captures increase at lease renewal
- No private speculation on publicly-created value
- Revenue funds public housing (82% of population lives in HDB)
- Homeownership rate: 90%+ (highest in the world)

**Annual revenue from land sales:** $15-25 billion (varies by year)—roughly 15-20% of total government revenue.

**The tradeoff:** Singapore's model requires authoritarian land control incompatible with most democratic systems. But the principle—public capture of publicly-created value—adapts to democratic contexts.

### Case Study: Taiwan

Taiwan combines democratic governance with systematic land value capture.

**The Land-to-the-Tiller program (1953):**
- Redistributed agricultural land to farmers
- Former landlords compensated with industrial shares
- Created the economic foundation for democratic development

**Modern land policy:**
- Land value increment tax (LVIT): taxes the increase in land value at sale
- Rates: 20-40% of appreciation, depending on holding period
- Revenue funds infrastructure and public services
- Prevents pure speculation while allowing productive development

**Results:**
- Taiwan's land speculation is constrained compared to peers
- High homeownership rates
- Broad wealth distribution
- Democratic consolidation (economic stake creates political stake)

### Tax Increment Financing (TIF)

TIF is a weaker but more politically feasible form of value capture.

**How it works:**
1. City designates a TIF district
2. Property values frozen at current baseline
3. City invests in infrastructure/improvements
4. Property values rise
5. The "increment" (new taxes above baseline) funds the original investment
6. After payoff, increment flows to general fund

**Advantages:**
- Self-financing infrastructure
- No new taxes on existing residents
- Captures some publicly-created value

**Problems:**
- Often captured by developers (who negotiate TIF terms)
- Can starve schools and other services (frozen baseline)
- Doesn't capture existing speculation

**Better TIF design:**
- Citizen board oversight (not just city council)
- Mandatory affordable housing percentages
- Revenue sharing with school districts
- Sunset provisions (no perpetual TIF districts)

### Community Land Trusts (CLTs)

CLTs remove land from the speculative market permanently.

**Structure:**
- Nonprofit owns land in perpetuity
- Residents own buildings/improvements
- Resale restrictions limit profit (typically CPI + 25%)
- Affordability locked forever

**Champlain Housing Trust (Burlington, VT):**
- Founded 1984, largest CLT in United States
- 3,000+ units of permanently affordable housing
- $0 public subsidy for operations (self-sustaining)
- Homeownership for families earning 60-80% AMI
- Resale restrictions ensure next buyer also gets affordable price

**The math:**
- Median Burlington home: $450,000 (2024)
- CLT home: $225,000 (permanently restricted)
- Savings per family: $225,000 in purchase price
- Public cost: Initial land acquisition only
- Duration: Permanent (land never returns to market)

**Scaling CLTs:**
- UK: 300+ CLTs, accelerating formation
- Brussels: Government-backed CLT serving 15% of city
- Puerto Rico: Caño Martín Peña CLT (community-driven post-disaster)

### The Political Economy of Land Value Capture

Why, if land value taxation is so economically sensible, hasn't it been adopted universally?

**The Concentrated Opposition Problem:**

Landowners who would lose from LVT are concentrated, organized, and politically powerful. Residents who would gain are diffuse, disorganized, and often unaware of the mechanism.

Consider the stakeholder landscape for a typical city:

| Stakeholder | Impact of LVT | Political Power | Organization |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Large landowners | Lose significantly | Very high | Well organized |
| Developers | Mixed (depends on land holdings) | High | Organized |
| Homeowners (median) | Roughly neutral | Medium | Dispersed |
| Renters | Gain (lower land costs → lower rents) | Low | Dispersed |
| Businesses (non-land) | Gain (lower location costs) | Medium | Some organization |
| Future residents | Gain significantly | None | Non-existent |

**Political strategy for LVT adoption:**

**1. Start with commercial/industrial:**
- Less emotional attachment than residential
- Clearer economic logic (business owners understand)
- Easier to demonstrate benefits
- Creates precedent without homeowner backlash

**2. Phase residential gradually:**
- 10-year phase-in allows adjustment
- Exemptions for primary residence below median value
- Revenue-neutral initially (offset with other tax cuts)
- Visible service improvements from captured revenue

**3. Build coalitions:**
- Young people (priced out of housing market)
- Renters (lower eventual rents)
- Small businesses (lower location costs)
- Environmental groups (denser development)
- Fiscal conservatives (efficient taxation)

**4. Create visible benefits:**
- Land value capture funds specific projects
- Named improvements: "This park funded by land value capture"
- Annual statements showing per-resident benefit
- Dashboard tracking captured value and its use

**5. Address legitimate concerns:**
- Elderly homeowners on fixed income: deferral until sale
- Small landlords: phase-in and exemptions
- Agricultural land at urban edge: use-value assessment

The political path exists. It requires strategy, not just good economics.

### Land Value Capture 2.0: The Living City Model

Existing mechanisms are piecemeal. Living cities integrate them into a coherent system:

**The Integrated Stack:**

| Layer | Mechanism | Capture Rate | Use |
|-------|-----------|--------------|-----|
| 1. Baseline | Land value tax | 2-5% annually | General operations |
| 2. Increment | TIF with citizen oversight | 50% of appreciation | Infrastructure investment |
| 3. Transaction | Land transfer tax | 5-10% at sale | Housing trust fund |
| 4. Permanent | CLT acquisition | 100% for acquired land | Permanent affordability |

**Implementation sequence for a mid-size city (500,000 population):**

**Year 1-2:**
- Complete land value assessment (separate land from improvements)
- Pilot TIF district with citizen oversight board
- Establish CLT with seed funding from land transfer tax increase
- Estimate: $50-100M in captured value

**Year 3-5:**
- Phase in split-rate property tax (shift from improvements to land)
- Expand CLT to 5% of residential parcels
- Implement increment-sharing with schools
- Estimate: $150-300M in captured value

**Year 5-10:**
- Full land value tax on commercial/industrial land
- CLT at 15% of residential parcels
- Export model to metropolitan region
- Estimate: $300-500M annually

**Political pathway:**
- Begin with commercial/industrial (less political resistance)
- Phase residential slowly (allow adjustment)
- Exemptions for primary residence up to median value
- Revenue visible in services (parks, transit, housing)

## 2. ABUNDANCE DIVIDENDS

### The Alaska Model

In 1976, Alaska established the Permanent Fund. Oil revenues flow into the fund. The fund invests globally. Annual dividends flow to every Alaska resident.

**The numbers (1982-2024):**
- Total distributed: $28+ billion
- Annual dividend range: $1,000-$3,269 per person
- Family of four receives: $4,000-$13,000 per year
- Fund size: $80+ billion (2024)

**The mechanism:**
- 25% of oil royalties deposited in Permanent Fund
- Fund invested in global portfolio
- 5% of fund value distributed as dividend
- Every resident receives equal share

**Political durability:**
- 1999 ballot measure to use fund for government: rejected 84%
- Dividend is constitutionally protected
- Bipartisan support (ownership transcends ideology)

**Why it works:**
- Citizens feel ownership of state resources
- Visible, tangible benefit creates political protection
- Dividend reduces poverty directly
- Local spending stimulates economy

### From Oil to Urban Metabolism

Alaska's model applies to ANY publicly-owned resource generating returns. In cities, those resources include:

**1. Land value (covered above):**
- Publicly-created value
- Captured through LVT, TIF, CLT
- Dividend potential: $500-2,000/resident/year in high-value cities

**2. Data:**
- Resident-generated, platform-captured
- Captured through data cooperatives
- Dividend potential: $50-500/resident/year

**3. Infrastructure returns:**
- Transit, energy, water generate operating margins
- Currently captured by private operators or general fund
- Dividend potential: $100-300/resident/year

**4. Spectrum and rights-of-way:**
- Public airwaves, underground conduits
- Currently leased below value or given away
- Dividend potential: $50-200/resident/year

**5. Carbon/pollution:**
- Carbon taxes, pollution fees
- Currently flow to general fund
- Dividend potential: $100-500/resident/year (varies by policy)

### The Urban Abundance Fund

A living city establishes an **Urban Abundance Fund** modeled on Alaska:

**Structure:**
- Endowment held in perpetuity
- Revenue sources: land value capture, data dividends, infrastructure returns, carbon fees
- Investment: global diversified portfolio
- Distribution: equal per-capita dividend to all residents

**Illustrative budget for a city of 1 million:**

| Revenue Source | Annual Flow | Notes |
|----------------|-------------|-------|
| Land value tax (2%) | $400M | At $200B land value |
| Data cooperative licensing | $50M | Pooled resident data |
| Transit operating margin | $75M | After reinvestment |
| Carbon/congestion fees | $100M | Passed through to users |
| Spectrum/ROW leases | $25M | 5G, fiber, utilities |
| **Total** | **$650M** | |

**Distribution:**
- Fund 5% rule: $650M enables $32.5M fund growth + $617.5M distribution
- Per resident: $617/year
- Family of four: $2,468/year

**Not life-changing, but:**
- Visible ownership stake
- Builds over time (fund compounds)
- Creates political constituency for value capture
- Establishes principle: residents own city returns

### Data Dividends: The New Urban Commons

Data is the oil of the 21st century—but unlike oil, data is produced by everyone, everywhere, constantly. Every transit trip generates data. Every energy usage pattern generates data. Every movement through the city, every transaction, every interaction generates data.

**Who currently captures this value?**

Google knows more about your city's mobility patterns than your transit authority. Uber knows your trip patterns. Airbnb knows your housing market. Amazon knows your consumption. Your utility company sells your energy data to third parties. Your credit card company sells your transaction data.

The aggregate value of urban resident data in the United States alone is estimated at $150-300 billion annually. Virtually all of it flows to platforms and data brokers. Residents receive none of it.

**The ownership principle:**

If you generate data, you should own it. If your data generates value, you should share in that value. This is not radical—it's the basic principle of property rights applied to a new asset class.

**Why collective bargaining matters:**

Individual data has limited value. Your mobility patterns alone are worth perhaps $0.50 to a researcher. But aggregated mobility data for a city of one million? That's worth millions. 

This is why data cooperatives are essential. Individual exit has no leverage. Collective bargaining does. When 500,000 residents own their data cooperatively, they can negotiate with platforms, researchers, and advertisers from a position of power.

**The technical infrastructure:**

Modern privacy-preserving techniques make data cooperatives practical:

- **Federated learning:** AI models train on data where it lives; only model updates leave, not raw data
- **Differential privacy:** Mathematical guarantees that individual records cannot be reconstructed
- **Homomorphic encryption:** Computation on encrypted data without decryption
- **Zero-knowledge proofs:** Verify properties without revealing underlying data

These aren't theoretical—they're deployed at scale by Apple, Google, and others. The same technology that enables platform extraction can enable cooperative ownership.

Data cooperatives generate revenue that flows to member-owners:

**The MIDATA model (Switzerland):**
- 10,000+ members own health data cooperatively
- Researchers/pharma pay for anonymized access
- Revenue distributed to members after operating costs

**Urban data cooperative potential:**

| Data Type | Estimated Value/Person/Year | Mechanism |
|-----------|----------------------------|-----------|
| Location/mobility | $50-100 | Transit planning, retail analytics |
| Energy usage | $20-50 | Grid optimization, efficiency programs |
| Housing data | $10-30 | Research, tenant organizing |
| Transaction data | $100-200 | Financial services, economic research |
| Health data | $50-150 | Research, insurance, pharma |
| **Total** | **$230-530** | |

**Implementation pathway:**

**Phase 1 (Year 1-2):**
- Establish city data cooperative (municipal charter)
- Begin with mobility data (transit cards, anonymized location)
- First research contracts: $5-10M
- Per-member dividend: $5-20

**Phase 2 (Year 3-5):**
- Add energy, housing, transaction data
- Corporate licensing deals: $25-50M
- Per-member dividend: $50-100

**Phase 3 (Year 5-10):**
- Full data portfolio
- Sovereign data negotiations (city-to-city)
- Per-member dividend: $200-500

**The Barcelona model:**
Barcelona's Decidim platform and data sovereignty policies point the way:
- All city-generated data is public by default
- Private operators must share operational data
- Citizens can access and control their own data
- Foundation for cooperative ownership

### Carbon Dividend

Carbon pricing with full dividend return is the most efficient climate policy:

**The mechanism:**
- Tax carbon emissions at source (fuel, electricity, industry)
- Return 100% of revenue as equal per-capita dividend
- Higher emitters pay more than they receive
- Lower emitters receive more than they pay
- Progressive by income (rich emit more)

**British Columbia (2008-present):**
- Carbon tax: $50/tonne (rising)
- Revenue neutral: all returns to residents/businesses
- Emissions: down 5-15% (depending on methodology)
- Economy: outperformed Canadian average

**Proposed US federal dividend ($50/tonne):**
- Annual revenue: ~$200 billion
- Per adult dividend: ~$800/year
- Household of four: ~$1,600/year

**City-level application:**
- Congestion pricing (NYC, London, Singapore)
- Currently revenue goes to transit operations
- Alternative: 50% to transit, 50% to dividend
- NYC congestion pricing: ~$1B/year = $60/resident dividend

### The Abundance Stack

Living cities stack multiple dividend streams:

**Full-stack dividend for a city of 1 million:**

| Source | Per Resident/Year |
|--------|------------------|
| Land value capture dividend | $400 |
| Data cooperative dividend | $150 |
| Carbon/congestion dividend | $100 |
| Infrastructure returns | $75 |
| Spectrum/ROW | $25 |
| **Total** | **$750** |

**Family of four: $3,000/year**

This is not UBI. It is **ownership income**—the return on collectively-owned assets. It scales with the value of those assets. It creates constituency for protecting and growing those assets.

**Political psychology:**
- "The government is giving you money" → dependence
- "Your assets are generating returns" → ownership

The difference matters. Dividends from ownership create agency. Transfers from government create dependence.

## 3. CITIZEN INVESTMENT TRUSTS

### The Problem with Municipal Finance

Traditional municipal finance has three options:

**1. Taxation:** Politically constrained, often regressive, creates no ownership

**2. Debt (bonds):** Creates obligations, often held by external investors, repayment drains local wealth

**3. Private investment:** Requires returns to external shareholders, eventual extraction

All three have the same problem: **Residents pay but don't own.**

The alternative: **Citizen Investment Trusts**—mechanisms for residents to own the infrastructure they fund.

### The History and Logic of Community Ownership

Community ownership of infrastructure is not new. It is, in fact, the original model.

**Historical precedent:**

In medieval Europe, the "commons" included forests, grazing lands, waterways, and other resources owned collectively. The enclosure movement—privatizing common land—created the landless labor force that fueled industrialization. This was presented as economic progress. It was also massive theft.

In early America, many utilities began as cooperatives:
- Rural electric cooperatives (900+ still exist, serving 42 million Americans)
- Telephone cooperatives (rural areas underserved by Bell)
- Water cooperatives (community wells and distribution)
- Credit unions (originally community savings pools)

These weren't socialist experiments. They were practical solutions when private capital wouldn't serve. They worked. Many still work.

**Why community ownership disappeared from cities:**

As cities grew, infrastructure became more capital-intensive. Railroads, power plants, water treatment—these required investment beyond community capacity. Two models emerged:

**Model A: Private monopoly with regulation**
- Private company builds and operates
- Government regulates rates and service
- Profits flow to shareholders
- Example: Most US utilities, transit pre-1950s

**Model B: Public ownership**
- Government builds and operates
- Taxpayers fund, users pay fares/rates
- Deficits covered by taxes
- Example: Most transit post-1960s, many water systems

Both models share a feature: **Residents are customers, not owners.**

In Model A, owners are shareholders (often distant investors). In Model B, the owner is "the public" in theory, but in practice there's no individual ownership stake. You can't sell your share of the New York subway.

**The third model: Community ownership at scale**

Modern cooperative law, blockchain ownership tracking, and digital governance tools make a third model possible:

**Model C: Cooperative ownership**
- Community members own directly (shares)
- Governance through member voting
- Profits return as dividends or service improvement
- Exit possible (sell shares back to cooperative or new members)

This combines the efficiency incentives of private ownership with the community benefit of public ownership. Owners care about service quality (they use it) and cost efficiency (dividends depend on it).

### Community Ownership of Urban Infrastructure

**The principle:** When residents pay for infrastructure (through taxes, fees, or direct investment), they should own it.

**Existing models:**

**1. Customer-Owned Utilities:**
- 2,000+ municipal electric utilities in US
- Rates 10-15% lower than investor-owned
- Profits return to community (rate reduction or services)
- Example: Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD)—500,000 customers, rates 30% below PG&E

**2. Transit Cooperatives:**
- Community Transit (Snohomish County, WA)—rider advisory boards
- Potential: full rider ownership with equity stakes
- Operating surplus returns as service improvement or dividend

**3. Broadband Cooperatives:**
- 900+ community-owned broadband networks in US
- RS Fiber (Minnesota)—rural cooperative, gigabit speeds, rates 50% below Comcast
- Chattanooga (EPB)—municipal, attracted $1B in investment

### Municipal Cooperative Bonds

Traditional municipal bonds are held by institutional investors. Interest payments flow out of the community.

**Cooperative alternative:**

**Structure:**
- Bonds sold directly to residents
- Lower minimum ($100-500 vs. $5,000)
- Slightly below-market rate (offset by community benefit)
- Priority allocation to local residents
- Secondary market restricted to locals

**Benefits:**
- Interest stays in community
- Residents have stake in project success
- Democratic ownership of infrastructure
- Lower total cost (below-market rates)

**Example: Community Investment Notes**

The Calvert Foundation (now Calvert Impact Capital) pioneered community investment notes:
- Minimum investment: $20
- Returns: 0-3% depending on term
- Use: affordable housing, community development
- Total mobilized: $2+ billion

**Municipal adaptation:**

A city of 500,000 issues "Living City Bonds":
- Project: Transit modernization ($200M)
- Resident allocation: 50% ($100M)
- Minimum investment: $500
- Return: 3% annually (below market 4%)
- Term: 10 years
- Secondary trading: Local exchange only

**Participation math:**
- 100,000 households invest average $1,000 = $100M
- Annual interest to residents: $3M
- All interest circulates locally
- Residents own 50% of transit system

### Resident Equity Stakes in Development

When new development occurs, existing residents should have ownership opportunity.

**The problem:**
- Developer builds in neighborhood
- Property values rise
- Existing owners benefit (paper wealth)
- Renters priced out (no benefit, only cost)
- Value created by community captured by newcomers

**The solution: Development Equity Shares (DES)**

**Mechanism:**
1. New development requires community benefit agreement
2. Agreement includes equity pool (5-15% of project value)
3. Equity distributed to existing residents (renters and owners)
4. Residents share in project returns (dividends or appreciation)
5. Anti-displacement funding tied to equity value

**Example:**
- Developer proposes $100M mixed-use project
- Community benefit agreement: 10% equity pool ($10M)
- 5,000 neighborhood residents receive shares ($2,000 each)
- Project generates 8% annual return
- Per-resident dividend: $160/year
- Over 20 years: $3,200 in dividends + appreciation

**Existing precedent:**
- The 11th Street Bridge project (DC) requires local hiring and equity participation
- Atlanta BeltLine includes community benefits (though not equity)
- San Francisco Prop I (2020): Increased transfer tax for community stabilization

### The Stakeholder City

Living cities make residents stakeholders, not just taxpayers:

**Full stakeholder model:**

| Infrastructure | Ownership Mechanism | Resident Stake |
|----------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Energy | Municipal/cooperative utility | Rate-payer equity |
| Transit | Rider cooperative | Fare-payer equity |
| Broadband | Community network | Subscriber equity |
| Housing | Community land trust | Resident ownership |
| Development | Equity shares | Neighborhood stakes |
| Data | Data cooperative | Member dividends |

**Each resident holds:**
- Utility equity (from rate payments)
- Transit equity (from fare payments)
- Data dividends (from data production)
- Development shares (from neighborhood investment)
- Abundance Fund dividend (from collective assets)

**The result:** A portfolio of ownership stakes in the city's infrastructure and growth.

### Implementation: The Living City Investment Authority

Cities establish a **Living City Investment Authority (LCIA)** to coordinate:

**Functions:**
1. Issue cooperative bonds for infrastructure
2. Manage resident equity programs
3. Oversee development benefit agreements
4. Administer dividend distributions
5. Track resident ownership portfolios

**Governance:**
- Board: 50% elected by investor-residents, 50% appointed by city
- Transparent accounting (blockchain-verified)
- Annual assembly of investor-residents
- Sunset provisions (no perpetual authority)

**Seed funding:**
- Land value capture revenues
- Federal/state infrastructure funds (with ownership conditions)
- Philanthropic capital (impact investors)
- Cooperative bond proceeds

## 4. GLOBAL COORDINATION

### The Piketty Model Adapted for Cities

Thomas Piketty's proposal for a global wealth tax addresses the core problem: mobile capital escapes national taxation while labor cannot escape.

**Piketty's proposal:**
- Global registry of financial assets
- Automatic information exchange between countries
- Progressive wealth tax (0.1% below €1M, 0.5% to €5M, 2% above €5M)
- Estimated revenue: €250-500 billion globally

**Urban adaptation:**

Cities face the same problem at local scale. Wealthy residents can move to avoid local taxes. Capital flows to lowest-tax jurisdictions. Race to the bottom ensues.

**Solution: Metropolitan and regional tax coordination**

**Model: Nordic cooperation**
- Nordic countries share tax information automatically
- Coordinated corporate taxation prevents arbitrage
- Result: highest taxes AND highest prosperity globally

**Metropolitan application:**

A metro region of 5 million coordinates:
- Shared land value tax across jurisdictions
- Uniform data cooperative standards
- Coordinated development benefit requirements
- Regional abundance fund

**The math:**
- Uncoordinated: each city offers tax breaks, sum = zero
- Coordinated: no arbitrage, full value captured
- Regional land value capture: $2-5B annually
- Regional abundance dividend: $400-1,000/resident

### Inter-City Coordination: The C40 Model

C40 Cities connects 96 megacities (700 million people) on climate action.

**Existing achievements:**
- Shared procurement (electric buses, solar)
- Technical assistance (city-to-city learning)
- Climate finance mobilization ($1B+ in committed investment)
- Deadline diplomacy (2030 targets)

**Living Cities extension:**

A **Living Cities Alliance** coordinates on:

**1. Data sovereignty standards:**
- Mutual recognition of data cooperative charters
- Inter-city data sharing protocols
- Collective bargaining with platforms (Google, Uber, Airbnb)

**2. Land value capture best practices:**
- Shared assessment methodologies
- Anti-arbitrage coordination
- Cross-border land trust networks

**3. Citizen investment standards:**
- Mutual recognition of cooperative bonds
- Cross-city resident investment opportunities
- Shared clearing for local currencies

**4. Global abundance fund:**
- Pooled revenues from participating cities
- Investment in global portfolio
- Dividends to all participating residents

### Climate Finance for Urban Transitions

Climate finance is the largest pool of transitional capital available—and the most contested.

**The broken promise:**

At Copenhagen in 2009, developed countries promised $100 billion per year by 2020 for developing country climate action. This promise has never been fully met. Even the funds that do flow are:

- Heavily skewed toward mitigation (profitable solar projects) over adaptation (protecting vulnerable communities)
- Mostly loans, not grants (adding to debt burdens)
- Slow to disburse (years between approval and spending)
- Captured by consultants and intermediaries (30-40% in transaction costs)

**The opportunity:**

Despite these problems, climate finance is the most accessible large-scale capital for urban transformation in the Global South. The key is structuring access to serve living city principles.

**Why cities, not countries:**

Climate finance traditionally flows through national governments. This creates problems:
- National politics delays urban projects
- Capital cities capture disproportionate share
- No direct relationship between funders and recipients
- Corruption filters significant percentages

The alternative: **Direct city access** to climate finance.

C40 Cities has pioneered this approach:
- Cities apply directly to climate funds
- City governments accountable to local residents
- Projects tailored to local conditions
- Faster disbursement, lower transaction costs

**Green Climate Fund urban window:**

The GCF has begun direct engagement with cities:
- $500M+ committed to urban projects since 2015
- Direct access available for cities meeting fiduciary standards
- Technical assistance for cities building capacity
- Focus on integrated urban projects (not single-sector)

**Example: Medellín Green Corridors**

Medellín, Colombia accessed $7M in climate finance for green corridors:
- 30 green corridors planted throughout city
- Temperature reduction of 2-4°C in corridor areas
- 880,000 residents directly benefited
- Local ownership through community maintenance contracts
- Replicable model exported to other Colombian cities

The project succeeded because:
- City had direct relationship with funders
- Community ownership built into design
- Multiple benefits (climate, health, equity)
- Local employment for maintenance

**Scaling climate finance for living cities:**

The current climate finance architecture can be redirected:

| Current Practice | Living City Alternative |
|------------------|------------------------|
| National government access | Direct city access |
| Single-sector projects | Integrated urban transformation |
| Loans | Grants + concessional finance |
| Private ownership | Community ownership requirements |
| Consultant-heavy | Local capacity building |

**The ask for climate negotiators:**

1. Establish 60%+ allocation for urban projects
2. Create direct city access pathway for all funds
3. Mandate community ownership for funded infrastructure
4. Include resident dividend requirements
5. Fund capacity building, not just infrastructure

### South-South Investment Flows

Northern capital often comes with extraction strings. South-South investment offers alternatives.

**Existing mechanisms:**

**1. BRICS New Development Bank:**
- $100B capitalization
- Infrastructure focus
- No Washington Consensus conditions
- Growing urban portfolio

**2. Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB):**
- $100B capitalization
- 109 member countries
- Urban infrastructure eligible

**3. South-South bilateral:**
- China-Africa infrastructure ($150B since 2000)
- India-Africa development cooperation
- Brazil-CPLP (Portuguese-speaking) partnerships

**Living City conditions for South-South finance:**

**Minimum requirements:**
- Local ownership mandates (residents must own majority stake)
- Technology transfer requirements
- Local employment guarantees
- Environmental standards (no race to bottom)
- Democratic accountability (not just government-to-government)

**Example: Lagos-Nairobi Living City Fund**

African cities pool resources:
- 20 participating cities contribute 0.5% of budget
- Fund invests in living city infrastructure across network
- Returns flow back to participating cities
- Technical assistance shared
- Collective bargaining with global platforms

**Pooled resources:** $500M-1B
**Per-city allocation:** $25-50M for living city transition

### Global Wealth Tax Revenue Sharing

Piketty's global wealth tax, if implemented, could fund urban transitions globally:

**Revenue allocation formula:**

| Category | Allocation | Use |
|----------|-----------|-----|
| Origin city | 40% | Local living city fund |
| Global pool | 30% | Developing city transitions |
| Climate/environment | 20% | Green infrastructure |
| Administration | 10% | Registry, enforcement |

**At €300B global revenue:**
- Local allocation: €120B (to cities where wealth is held)
- Global pool: €90B (to developing cities)
- Climate: €60B (green infrastructure)
- Admin: €30B

**Per-capita for developing cities (4B population):**
- €22.50/person/year
- Not transformative alone, but stackable with other mechanisms

### The End of Tax Havens

Living cities require ending the race to bottom:

**Current problem:**
- Delaware incorporations drain tax from actual operating cities
- Switzerland/Singapore/Dubai capture mobile capital
- Cayman/Jersey/BVI enable full evasion
- Estimated annual loss: $500B-1T globally

**Solutions underway:**
- OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS)
- Global Minimum Corporate Tax (15%)
- Automatic exchange of financial information
- Beneficial ownership registries

**Living city advocacy priorities:**
1. National implementation of minimum tax
2. City-level participation in information exchange
3. Local beneficial ownership requirements
4. Exit taxes for corporate relocations

## 5. TRANSITION FINANCING

### The Chicken-Egg Problem

Living cities require:
- Infrastructure investment (expensive)
- New governance structures (time-consuming)
- Resident ownership mechanisms (complex)
- Political support (uncertain)

Each depends on the others. How do you start?

### Phased Approaches by City Size

Different scales require different sequences:

**SMALL CITIES (Under 100,000)**

**Advantages:**
- Personal relationships enable trust-building
- Simpler governance structures
- Faster iteration cycles
- Visible impact

**Sequence:**
1. **Year 1:** Community data cooperative (simple start)
   - Pool utility data from all residents
   - Negotiate bulk rates (immediate savings)
   - First dividend: $20-50/household
   - Cost: $50-100K

2. **Year 2-3:** Community land trust
   - Acquire 20-50 properties from willing sellers
   - Permanently affordable housing

### The First 100 Days: A Mayoral Playbook

A new mayor committed to living city principles:

**Days 1-30:**
1. Executive order: All city-generated data is public by default
2. Appoint Living City Transition Director (cabinet level)
3. Announce land value assessment (separate land from improvements)
4. Commission legal review: cooperative bond authority
5. Identify pilot neighborhoods (3-5 applications)

**Days 31-60:**
1. Launch resident data cooperative (opt-in)
2. Establish Citizen Investment Authority (advisory initially)
3. Release land value maps (public transparency)
4. Propose pilot TIF district with citizen oversight
5. Convene regional coordination conversations

**Days 61-100:**
1. First data cooperative licensing contracts
2. Pilot neighborhood selection announced
3. Development benefit policy published (required equity)
4. Cooperative bond enabling legislation introduced
5. 100-day report: metrics, timeline, public commitment

**Budget requirement for 100 days:** $1-5M (mostly staff time)

### Case Study: Bogotá's TransMilenio Transition

Bogotá, Colombia offers lessons in both success and failure for transition financing.

**The success (2000-2010):**
- TransMilenio bus rapid transit launched 2000
- Cost: $240M for initial corridors (vs. $2B+ for equivalent rail)
- Financed through: fuel tax increase, development impact fees, multilateral loans
- Result: 2.4M daily passengers, transformed mobility

**What worked:**
- Political leadership (Mayor Peñalosa's vision)
- Staged implementation (corridor by corridor)
- Revenue positive within 5 years (fare recovery)
- Visible impact (traffic congestion relief immediate)

**What failed:**
- No resident ownership structure
- Operator profits to private concessionaires
- System now overcrowded, underinvested
- No mechanism for community benefit beyond service

**The lesson:**

Bogotá built infrastructure successfully but without ownership mechanisms. Residents benefited from service but captured none of the value. As the system matured, private operators extracted surplus while public reinvestment lagged.

**The living city alternative would have:**
- Structured fare-payer equity from launch
- Required operator revenue sharing with community fund
- Created rider governance board with real authority
- Mandated that efficiency gains return partially as dividends

The difference between "public infrastructure" and "community-owned infrastructure" is the difference between service delivery and resident empowerment.

### The Venezuela Warning: What Not to Do

Venezuela's Bolivarian housing mission built 2.5 million units of social housing. By one metric, this was success. By living city metrics, it was a disaster.

**What went wrong:**
- No resident ownership (government retained title)
- No maintenance mechanism (buildings degraded immediately)
- No local governance (centralized decisions from Caracas)
- Debt-financed through oil revenue assumptions
- When oil crashed, maintenance stopped

**The result:** Buildings crumbling within a decade. Residents with no equity, no agency, no recourse. Government debt unpayable.

**The lesson:** Public housing without ownership is not a living city mechanism. It creates dependence, not agency. It builds structures, not institutions. When political priorities shift or revenues decline, residents are abandoned.

**Living city housing finance:**
- Resident ownership from occupancy
- Maintenance reserve built into financing
- Community land trust holds land
- Building cooperative handles operations
- Surplus returns to residents, not government

This costs more upfront. It costs far less over 30 years. And it builds citizen stake in system success.

### The Mondragon Model: Cooperative Finance at Scale

Mondragon Corporation in the Basque Country demonstrates cooperative finance at scale:

**The numbers:**
- Founded 1956 with 5 workers
- Today: 80,000+ worker-owners
- Revenue: €12B annually
- 96 cooperatives in manufacturing, retail, finance, education

**How it finances growth:**
- Caja Laboral (cooperative bank) provides capital
- Workers contribute 15% of salary to capital fund
- Profits distributed: 10% community, 45% reserves, 45% to worker accounts
- During downturns, wages cut before layoffs

**The 2008 test:**
- Global financial crisis hit manufacturing hard
- Fagor appliance division failed (first major failure)
- Workers reabsorbed into other cooperatives
- No mass unemployment
- System survived intact

**Application to urban finance:**

Cities could establish municipal cooperative banks on the Caja Laboral model:
- Deposits from residents and municipal funds
- Lending for cooperative housing, infrastructure, businesses
- Profits return to depositors and community fund
- Patient capital (50-100 year horizons)
- Local expertise in local projects

This isn't fantasy—community development financial institutions (CDFIs) in the US demonstrate the model at smaller scale. What's needed is municipal-level implementation.

### Avoiding Debt Traps

The transition must not create new forms of extraction:

**Principles:**
1. **Revenue positive by year 5:** Land value capture must exceed implementation costs
2. **No external debt for operations:** Bonds only for revenue-generating infrastructure
3. **Resident ownership of all debt:** Cooperative bonds, not Wall Street
4. **Sunset provisions:** All authorities and TIF districts expire and must be renewed

**Danger signs:**
- External consultants driving design (capture risk)
- Debt without ownership structures (extraction risk)
- Rushed timeline (governance risk)
- No citizen oversight (accountability risk)

**Safe signals:**
- Local staff building capacity
- Resident governance from day one
- Phased implementation with learning loops
- Transparent metrics and public reporting

### Organ-by-Organ Transition Economics

Each urban "organ" has its own transition economics:

**NOURISHMENT (Food Systems)**
- Investment: Urban agriculture, food co-ops, farm-to-city logistics
- Revenue source: Land use change (agricultural zones in city)
- Ownership: Food cooperative membership
- Timeline: 5-10 years for significant self-sufficiency
- Cost per 100K population: $10-30M

**METABOLISM (Energy)**
- Investment: Solar, storage, grid modernization
- Revenue source: Energy sales, demand response
- Ownership: Utility cooperative or municipal
- Timeline: 10-20 years for majority renewable
- Cost per 100K population: $100-300M

**CIRCULATION (Transit)**
- Investment: Electrification, frequency, coverage
- Revenue source: Fares, congestion pricing, land value around stations
- Ownership: Rider cooperative, municipal
- Timeline: 15-25 years for full modernization
- Cost per 100K population: $200-500M

**STRUCTURE (Housing)**
- Investment: CLT acquisition, affordable development
- Revenue source: Land value capture, stable rents
- Ownership: CLT, cooperative housing
- Timeline: 20-40 years for 30% community-owned
- Cost per 100K population: $500M-1B

**COGNITION (Information/Governance)**
- Investment: Data infrastructure, participation platforms
- Revenue source: Data licensing, efficiency gains
- Ownership: Data cooperative, municipal
- Timeline: 3-7 years for functional system
- Cost per 100K population: $5-20M

**IMMUNITY (Conflict Resolution)**
- Investment: Restorative justice, community mediation
- Revenue source: Reduced incarceration costs, insurance
- Ownership: Community organizations
- Timeline: 10-20 years for culture shift
- Cost per 100K population: $10-30M

**REPRODUCTION (Education/Culture)**
- Investment: Universal pre-K, lifelong learning, cultural facilities
- Revenue source: Land value around schools, productivity gains
- Ownership: Community trusts, cooperatives
- Timeline: 15-25 years for full coverage
- Cost per 100K population: $100-300M

**EXCRETION (Waste/Regeneration)**
- Investment: Circular economy, composting, recycling
- Revenue source: Resource recovery, reduced disposal costs
- Ownership: Municipal or cooperative
- Timeline: 10-15 years for circular system
- Cost per 100K population: $50-150M

**Total transition cost per 100K population:** $975M-2.4B over 20-40 years

**Annual revenue once complete:** $150-400M per 100K (self-sustaining + dividend-generating)

### The Role of Philanthropy

Private philanthropy can seed living city transitions, but must be structured carefully.

**Appropriate uses:**
- Capacity building (staff, training, technical assistance)
- Pilot projects (demonstration before public commitment)
- Research (documenting what works)
- Advocacy (policy change campaigns)
- Bridge financing (before revenue mechanisms mature)

**Inappropriate uses:**
- Ongoing operations (creates dependence)
- Core infrastructure (should be publicly/cooperatively owned)
- Anything requiring perpetual funding

**The Ford Foundation urban model:**
- $1B+ committed to inclusive economies
- Focus on building institutions, not delivering services
- Exit timeline built into every grant
- Local ownership as success metric

**The MacArthur "housing stability" model:**
- $500M over 5 years
- Supports land trusts, cooperatives, policy advocacy
- Creates infrastructure for affordable housing
- Not building units directly

**The Bloomberg Philanthropies model:**
- Innovation funds for city government
- Direct technical assistance
- Peer learning networks (mayoral summits)
- Builds capacity, doesn't replace public finance

**What philanthropies should fund for living cities:**
1. First data cooperative implementations ($5-10M each)
2. Land value assessment methodology development
3. Cooperative bond legal frameworks (by jurisdiction)
4. Living city mayoral network
5. Research documenting outcomes

**What philanthropies should NOT fund:**
1. Ongoing service delivery
2. Deficit coverage for underfunded public systems
3. Any project without ownership transition plan
4. "Pilots" designed to justify ongoing philanthropy

The best philanthropic dollar is one that makes the next dollar unnecessary.

### Technology Requirements and Costs

Funding living cities requires digital infrastructure. The costs are often overestimated:

**Data cooperative platform:**
- Open-source platforms exist (MIDATA, Solid)
- Customization for local context: $500K-2M
- Ongoing maintenance: $200K-500K annually
- Per-member cost at 100K members: $2-7/year

**Cooperative ownership tracking:**
- Blockchain-based ownership registries available
- Implementation cost: $200K-1M depending on scale
- Operating cost: <$100K annually
- Transaction cost: <$1 per transfer

**Citizen participation platforms:**
- Decidim (Barcelona): open source, free
- Implementation: $100K-500K
- Localization and customization: $50K-200K
- Annual operations: $100K-300K

**Land value assessment:**
- GIS systems and property databases: existing in most cities
- Methodology development: $500K-2M (consultants + staff time)
- Ongoing maintenance: existing assessment staff
- Per-parcel annual cost: $5-20

**Total technology cost for transition (mid-size city):**
- Year 1-3: $2-5M
- Ongoing: $500K-1M annually
- Per resident: $5-20 one-time, $1-2 annually

**The technology is cheap. The governance is hard.**

This is why "smart city" projects fail—they assume technology is the constraint. In reality, technology for living cities costs less than one highway interchange. The constraint is political will and institutional capacity.

## Conclusion: The Metabolic Economy

The challenge of funding living cities is not fundamentally about money. It is about flow.

Current urban economies are constipated. Value accumulates in land speculation while infrastructure starves. Profits extract to distant shareholders while residents struggle. Data flows to platforms while communities remain data-poor.

The mechanisms in this chapter—land value capture, abundance dividends, citizen investment, global coordination, phased transition—are not technical fixes. They are metabolic interventions. They restore circulation to a blocked system.

**The summary:**

| Mechanism | What It Does | Scale |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Land value capture | Returns public-created value to public | $500-5,000/resident/year |
| Abundance dividends | Ownership income from collective assets | $500-2,000/resident/year |
| Citizen investment | Resident ownership of infrastructure | Equity stake in city systems |
| Global coordination | Stops race to bottom, enables cooperation | Multiplier on all above |
| Phased transition | Manages change without debt traps | 10-40 years depending on scale |

**The result:** Cities that fund themselves through value circulation rather than extraction. Residents who own the systems that serve them. Abundance that flows rather than hoards.

This is not utopian. Every mechanism described exists somewhere. Land value taxes work in Pennsylvania and Taiwan. Community land trusts work in Burlington and Brussels. Data cooperatives work in Switzerland. Permanent funds work in Alaska. Cooperative utilities work in Sacramento.

The innovation is integration—combining these mechanisms into a coherent system that funds the transition to living cities while building resident ownership at every stage.

### The Moral Case for Ownership Finance

Beyond efficiency, beyond practicality, there is a moral case for living city finance.

**The basic argument:**

1. Value is created collectively. No individual creates the value of a location. The value of urban land comes from the community—infrastructure, services, neighbors, culture, institutions. This is not labor theory of value; it is simply recognizing that location value is socially produced.

2. What is collectively created should be collectively owned. When my labor creates value, I own that value. When OUR collective presence creates value, WE should own that value. This is not redistribution—it is proper attribution of ownership.

3. Current systems misattribute ownership. When I buy land, I'm not buying my labor—I'm buying the option to capture future socially-created value. When platforms capture my data, they're not compensating me for what I produced. When private utilities profit from publicly-granted monopolies, they're extracting collectively-created value.

4. Living city finance corrects these misattributions. Land value capture returns socially-created value to the society that created it. Data dividends return individually-produced value to the individuals who produced it. Cooperative ownership returns infrastructure value to the residents who depend on it.

**This is not socialism.** Socialism proposes collective ownership of means of production. Living cities propose correct attribution of already-existing collective creation. The factory worker's labor should belong to the worker. The community's land value should belong to the community. Both are property rights properly understood.

**This is not capitalism's enemy.** It is capitalism's completion. Markets work better when property rights are correctly assigned. Competition works better when monopolies don't extract. Innovation works better when creators capture returns. Living city finance removes the distortions that make capitalism dysfunctional.

**The dignity argument:**

There is also simple dignity in ownership. A renter has no stake. A fare-payer has no voice. A data subject has no agency. 

An owner—even a small owner, even a fractional owner—has standing. They belong. They participate. They matter in a way that customers and subjects do not.

Living city finance creates a city of owners. Not wealthy owners. Not landed gentry. Owners of stakes in the systems that serve them. This is the difference between a city of residents and a city of citizens.

**The choice for city finance officers:**

You can continue the current model: debt-financed infrastructure owned by external investors, value extraction through speculation, residents as taxpayers and rate-payers but never owners.

Or you can begin the transition: capturing publicly-created value, distributing ownership through cooperative mechanisms, building an abundance fund that grows with the city, creating the conditions for generous living.

The math works. The precedents exist. The mechanisms are proven.

What remains is political will—and the recognition that funding the organism is not charity, not redistribution, not socialism. It is the restoration of property rights to those who create value. It is capitalism working correctly.

**A final word on time:**

This transition will not happen in one budget cycle. It will not happen in one mayoral term. The living cities that exist in 2075—where our children and grandchildren will live—will be shaped by decisions made in the next decade.

The question is not whether we can afford to fund the transition. The question is whether we can afford not to. 

Every year of delay, land values accumulate to speculators. Every year of delay, data flows to platforms. Every year of delay, infrastructure ages without ownership transition.

Start small. Start now. A single land value pilot district. A data cooperative for one neighborhood. One development with resident equity. These seeds, planted now, become the forests of the next generation.

The blood must flow. The organs must be fed. The living city awaits its circulation.

## Appendix: Key Numbers for City Finance Officers

### Land Value Capture Potential

| City Population | Estimated Land Value | Annual LVT at 2% | Per Resident |
|-----------------|---------------------|------------------|--------------|
| 100,000 | $10-30B | $200-600M | $2,000-6,000 |
| 500,000 | $50-150B | $1-3B | $2,000-6,000 |
| 1,000,000 | $100-400B | $2-8B | $2,000-8,000 |
| 5,000,000 | $500B-2T | $10-40B | $2,000-8,000 |

*Actual capture would be partial; full LVT is politically infeasible. Target: 25-50% of potential.*

### Abundance Dividend Projections

| Revenue Stack | Low Estimate | High Estimate |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| Land value (captured) | $200/resident | $1,000/resident |
| Data dividends | $50/resident | $300/resident |
| Carbon/congestion | $50/resident | $300/resident |
| Infrastructure returns | $50/resident | $200/resident |
| **Total** | **$350/resident** | **$1,800/resident** |

*For a family of four: $1,400-7,200/year in ownership income.*

### Cooperative Bond Terms (Benchmarks)

| Term | Rate | Minimum | Resident Allocation |
|------|------|---------|-------------------|
| 5 year | 2-3% | $100 | 50% of issue |
| 10 year | 3-4% | $500 | 50% of issue |
| 20 year | 4-5% | $1,000 | 50% of issue |

*Rates below market; offset by community benefit and ownership stake.*

### Global Funding Sources

| Source | Annual Availability | Accessibility |
|--------|-------------------|---------------|
| Climate Investment Funds | $2-3B | Moderate |
| Green Climate Fund | $5-10B | Moderate |
| World Bank Urban | $10-15B | Difficult |
| AIIB | $5-10B | Moderate |
| Private climate finance | $50-100B | Varies |
| C40/city networks | Technical assistance | Easy |
