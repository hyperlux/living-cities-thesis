# Evolution Roadmap: Living Cities Thesis

**Current Version:** 2.0 (February 2026)  
**Score:** 9.2/10  
**Status:** Thesis-stage → Movement Bible

## What's Working (Keep & Amplify)

### Masterpiece-Level
- **Ninth Pillar chapter** (Meaning Infrastructure as integrative organ) — strongest single piece across all versions
- Eight Organs + Ninth Pillar synthesis feels inevitable
- Attractor-based governance as the operating system (not an aside)

### Structural Wins
- Hierarchy: Dying Machine → Anatomy → Living Systems → Becoming the Organism → Risks & Evolution
- Nested Governance as "urban cognition + immunity" — biological, not bureaucratic
- Tone: Jane Jacobs meets Stuart Kauffman meets 21st-century Auroville founder

### Framework Density
- Master organism diagram (8+1 with layered attractors)
- Multiple status currencies distributed across organs
- Temporal commons as circadian rhythms

## The 0.8 Gap (Version 3.0 Targets)

### 1. Depth Expansion: Immunity & Cognition
**Problem:** Shorter treatment than Nourishment/Metabolism  
**Need:** More meat on how attractors actually work in messy real-world politics

- [ ] Expand Immunity organ (conflict resolution, system threats, adaptive responses)
- [ ] Expand Cognition organ (decision-making under uncertainty, collective intelligence)
- [ ] Add attractor case studies: What happens when an attractor fails? Gets captured?

### 2. Global & Rural Pathways
**Problem:** "Living Cities" plural promises diversity; delivery is urban-Western-centric  
**Need:** Explicit pathways for non-Western megacities and bioregional/rural nodes

- [ ] Jakarta pathway (informal economy integration, flood adaptation)
- [ ] Lagos pathway (energy leapfrogging, informal governance formalization)
- [ ] São Paulo pathway (favela-city symbiosis, water stress)
- [ ] Rural/bioregional nodes chapter (food-sheds, energy-sheds, watershed governance)
- [ ] Global South financing mechanisms

### 3. Transition Psychology & Risks (Visceral)
**Problem:** Present but too abstract  
**Need:** Narrative case studies — real people, not just frameworks

- [ ] "Day in the life" vignettes at each maturity level (L1 → L5)
- [ ] Failure stories with names and faces (what went wrong in Songdo for residents?)
- [ ] Psychology of loss: What people give up, what they grieve, how they adapt
- [ ] Backlash scenarios: populist capture, tech-feudal drift, green gentrification

### 4. Actionability: Starter Kits
**Problem:** Checklists exist but aren't granular enough  
**Need:** 3x more actionable — ready to copy-paste into a city council memo

- [ ] City-by-city starter kits (population tiers: 50K, 500K, 5M, 50M)
- [ ] Funding playbooks (municipal bonds, cooperative shares, philanthropy, DAOs)
- [ ] 5-year attractor experiments (testable hypotheses, success metrics)
- [ ] Open-source governance templates (model bylaws, data cooperative charters)
- [ ] "First 30 Days" for a newly elected mayor who gets it

### 5. Voice Unification
**Problem:** 90% smooth, 10% stitched (poetic ↔ policy-wonk)  
**Need:** Final pass for tonal consistency

- [ ] Identify friction points (flag during next read-through)
- [ ] Decide on voice hierarchy: Lead with biology, support with policy? Or vice versa?
- [ ] Smooth transitions between systems thinking and institutional detail

## The North Star

> Living cities aren't built by vendors. They're grown by residents who govern what serves them. The scaffolding is what we build. The cathedral — quiet kindness, generous living — is what grows inside.
